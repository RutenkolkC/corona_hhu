# HHU information on coronavirus

## Current information on coronavirus

## Main points in brief

  * Persons who are required to undergo a period of self-isolation as stipulated in the General Regulations of the State of NRW must not enter HHU campus.
  * Persons from areas within Germany with a high number of coronavirus infections, and which sometimes are misleadingly called ‚risk areas‘, may still come to HHU. Only when an area has been put under quarantine by the authorities, persons from this area may no longer enter HHU campus.  
  * A simple face covering must be worn everywhere on HHU campus as well as all inside all buildings used by HHU. The only exceptions are for lecturers during their lectures, provided that the minimum distance of 1.5m to other persons can be maintained, and for employees in their own workspace, provided that the required hygiene measures (e.g. a minimum distance of 1.5m to other persons or separation by (acrylic glass) can be maintained there.   
  * The official welcome address for first-year students by the HHU President and the Vice President for the Quality in Studies will take place on 02 November 2020 during an [online welcome event for first-year students](https://hhu.expo-ip.com/).
  * Here you can find [ information about the organisation of on-campus courses and about how to deal with (suspected) infections in a teaching environment](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Handreichung_Lehre_WS2021_21.10.2020_01.pdf) (as from 21 October 2020).
  * Here you can find information about how affected [ HHU employees](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Hygienekonzept/Merkblatt_Umgang_mit_Verdachts-_und_Infektionsfaellen_2020-10-06_GB.pdf) and [ supervisors](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Hinweise_fuer_Fachvorgesetzte_Infektions-_und_Kontaktfaelle_2020-10-06_GB.pdf) should react in case of a (suspected) infection (as of 21 October 2020).
  * See this [link for HHU’s hygiene policy](https://www.corona.hhu.de/en/covid-19-suspected-and-confirmed-cases-hygiene-policy/covid-19-sitemap/corona-19-inhalte/hygiene-policy/hygiene-policy.html) with information on working in offices and laboratories, examinations, work placements/internships, meetings/conferences and seminar rooms .
  * Regulations and support available to scientists [can be found on this page](https://www.corona.hhu.de/en/for-employees/employees-sitemap/employees-topics/support-for-scientists-against-the-background-of-the-coronavirus-pandemic/support-for-scientists-against-the-background-of-the-coronavirus-pandemic.html). 
  * The regulations concerning work from home/telework as stipulated in the relevant service agreement have been suspended from 02 November to 30 November in the light of the relevant rulings by the Federal Government. Persons whose physical presence is required on campus as well as persons who can perform their duties only on campus continue to be obliged to come to campus for work. For all other persons it is possible to fully or in parts work from home/perform telework or mobile work. The responsible supervisors are tasked to organise and guarantee operational functions under these conditions.
  * From 26 October on, the main canteen (‚Mensa‘) will be open daily from 11:30am – 2pm and offer a limited choice of meals. If you wish to eat there you must book a seat up to 48 hours in advance via [the Studierendenwerk website](https://www.stw-d.de/).
  * Currently, we are receiving a lot of spam e-mails at HHU that are allegedly sent by ZIM or WHO – please be alert.

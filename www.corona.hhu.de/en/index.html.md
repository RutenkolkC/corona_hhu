# HHU information on coronavirus

## Current information on coronavirus

## Main points in brief

  * From 02 December on, in accordance with the new General Decree passed by the State of NRW, on-campus activities are no longer permitted until further notice. **Teaching will exclusively take place online.** One exception are classes and on-campus events where personal attendance is vital because the participants depend on special rooms (such as laboratories) or other special framework conditions (e.g. bedside teaching). Another exception are courses for first-year students in bachelor’s and state examination study programmes that have already started. In accordance with the previous regulations, examinations can still take place. Access to the library remains as is.
  * Persons who are required to undergo a period of self-isolation as stipulated in the General Regulations of the State of NRW must not enter HHU campus.
  * Persons from areas within Germany with a high number of coronavirus infections, and which sometimes are misleadingly called ‚risk areas‘, may still come to HHU. Only when an area has been put under quarantine by the authorities, persons from this area may no longer enter HHU campus. 
  * A simple face covering must be worn everywhere on HHU campus as well as all inside all buildings used by HHU. The only exceptions are for lecturers during their lectures, provided that the minimum distance of 1.5m to other persons can be maintained, and for employees in their own workspace, provided that the required hygiene measures (e.g. a minimum distance of 1.5m to other persons or separation by (acrylic) glass) can be maintained there.   Please observe the specifications regarding the organisation of on-campus courses at HHU for students and lecturers for winter semester 2020/2021 (as of: 09 November 2020) [[Download PDF](/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Handreichung_Lehre_WS2021_09.11.2020_eng.pdf)].
  * Here you can find information about how [ affected HHU employees](/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Hygienekonzept/Merkblatt_Umgang_mit_Verdachts-_und_Infektionsfaellen_2020-10-06_GB.pdf) and [ supervisors](/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Hinweise_fuer_Fachvorgesetzte_Infektions-_und_Kontaktfaelle_2020-10-06_GB.pdf) should react in case of a (suspected) infection.
  * See [this link for HHU’s hygiene policy](/en/covid-19-suspected-and-confirmed-cases-hygiene-policy) with information on working in offices and laboratories, examinations, work placements/internships, meetings/conferences and seminar rooms.
  * Regulations and support available to scientists are summarised [on this page](/en/for-employees#c452970).
  * The regulations concerning work from home/telework as stipulated in the relevant service agreement have been suspended from 02 November to 15 January 2021 in the light of the relevant rulings by the Federal Government. Persons whose physical presence is required on campus as well as persons who can perform their duties only on campus continue to be obliged to come to campus for work. For all other persons it is possible to fully or in parts work from home/perform telework or mobile work. The responsible supervisors are tasked to organise and guarantee operational functions under these conditions. 
  * From 26 October on, the main canteen (‚Mensa‘) will be open daily from 11:30am – 2pm and offer a limited choice of meals. If you wish to eat there you must book a seat up to 48 hours in advance [via the Studierendenwerk website](https://www.stw-d.de/).
  * Currently, we are receiving a lot of spam e-mails at HHU that are allegedly sent by ZIM or WHO – please be alert.

# HHU information on coronavirus

## Current information on coronavirus

## Main points in brief

  * The regulations concerning work from home/telework as stipulated in the relevant service agreement have been suspended until 19 March 2021 in the light of the relevant rulings by the German Federal Government and States. Persons whose physical presence on campus is essential to maintain operations continue to be obliged to come to campus to the extent that is necessary. All other persons have the option to fully or partially work from home/perform telework or mobile work. In light of the latest rates of new infections, all employees should make use of the option to work from home as much as possible and reduce their presence on campus to the extent that is really necessary. The responsible supervisors are tasked to organise operations in their respective area of responsibility under these conditions and at the same time reduce presence on campus of their team to the required amount.  
  * Oral exams must take place online. After authorisation by the responsible dean of studies and under strict observation of the hygiene and social distancing rules, written examinations may take place in person, provided that an examination result cannot be obtained by digital means. A medical face mask must be worn throughout the in-person written examination. Final theses and projects may continue and be registered, provided they do not include any on-campus components, or if the laboratory work, which must be in preparation of or part of an examination, has already begun and the responsible supervisor agrees to the continuation of the work.     
  * On the basis of the [SARS-CoV-2-Occupational Health and Safety Ordinance guidelines](https://www.bmas.de/DE/Service/Gesetze/sars-cov-2-arbeitsschutzverordnung.html) passed by the German Ministry of Labour on 21 January 2021 , which will be in force until 14 March for the time being, simple face coverings are not sufficient in case of the exceptions specified there (requirements regarding room occupation; minimum distance cannot be maintained; health hazards caused by increased exchange of aerosols). Instead, it is then mandatory to wear medical face masks or FFP2 masks. Masks of these types are available via HHU’s Lyreco web shop. Due to the explicit appeal to work from home/perform telework and the general hygiene and safety advice, the necessity to wear medical or FFP2 masks will only arise in very few exceptional cases. Owing to the specific requirements of their work in connection with patient care, UKD and Faculty of Medicine regulations apply for Faculty of Medicine and UKD employees.   
  * As a rule, in-person lectures are not allowed. Wherever possible, classes will continue to be taught online until the end of the lecture period. Laboratory placements and practical courses can only take place in-person in exceptional cases and only after authorisation by the dean of studies. For more information check the ‚students‘ and ‚lecturers‘ websites.    
  * For details about opening hours, access and the services provided by the University and State Library [check the following website ULB](https://www.hhu.de/en/about-hhu/university-and-state-library-ulb).
  * The rectorate has passed [ new regulations to specify the Corona Pandemic Ordinance](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/ZUV/Justitiariat/Amtliche_Bekanntmachungen/2020/2020_12_10_AB_66.pdf) (PDF). These regulations provide almost university-wide specifications regarding flexible teaching and examination formats, withdrawals from exams and additional attempts at passing examinations during the covid-19 pandemic.  
  * Persons who are required to undergo a period of self-isolation as stipulated in the General Regulations of the State of NRW must not enter HHU campus.
  * Persons from areas within Germany with a high number of coronavirus infections, and which sometimes are misleadingly called ‚risk areas‘, may still come to HHU. Only when an area has been put under quarantine by the authorities, persons from this area may no longer enter HHU campus. 
  * A simple face covering must be worn everywhere on HHU campus as well as all inside all buildings used by HHU. The only exceptions are for lecturers during their lectures, provided that the minimum distance of 1.5m to other persons can be maintained, and for employees in their own workspace, provided that the required hygiene measures (e.g. a minimum distance of 1.5m to other persons or separation by (acrylic) glass) can be maintained there.   Please observe the specifications regarding the organisation of on-campus courses at HHU for students and lecturers for winter semester 2020/2021 (as of: 09 November 2020) [[Download PDF](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Handreichung_Lehre_WS2021_09.11.2020_eng.pdf)].
  * Here you can find information about how [ affected HHU employees](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Hygienekonzept/Merkblatt_Umgang_mit_Verdachts-_und_Infektionsfaellen_2020-10-06_GB.pdf) and [ supervisors](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Hinweise_fuer_Fachvorgesetzte_Infektions-_und_Kontaktfaelle_2020-10-06_GB.pdf) should react in case of a (suspected) infection.
  * See [ this link for HHU’s hygiene policy](https://www.corona.hhu.de/en/covid-19-suspected-and-confirmed-cases-hygiene-policy) with information on working in offices and laboratories, examinations, work placements/internships, meetings/conferences and seminar rooms.
  * Regulations and support available to scientists are summarised [on this page](for-employees.html#c452970).
  * The Studierendenwerk has announced, that the main canteen (Mensa) in Universitätsstraße and all other cafés and canteens on HHU campus have closed on 16 December until further notice. For more information check the [Studierendenwek website](https://www.stw-d.de).
  * Currently, we are receiving a lot of spam e-mails at HHU that are allegedly sent by ZIM or WHO – please be alert.

## Information for HHU students

This website provides you with regularly updated information on general
regulations. You will receive further information by e-mail. In addition, we
recommend that you find out about the faculty-specific measures or course-
specific measures on the websites for your faculty and your study programme
and that you check your HHU e-mail account on regular basis.

## Main points for students in brief

  * A simple face covering must be worn everywhere on HHU campus as well as all inside all buildings used by HHU. The only exceptions are for lecturers during their lectures, provided that the minimum distance of 1.5m to other persons can be maintained, and for employees in their own workspace, provided that the required hygiene measures (e.g. a minimum distance of 1.5m to other persons or separation by (acrylic) glass) can be maintained there.   
  * Persons who are required to undergo a period of self-isolation as stipulated in the General Regulations of the State of NRW must not enter HHU campus.
  * Persons from areas within Germany with a high number of coronavirus infections, and which sometimes are misleadingly called ‚risk areas‘, may still come to HHU. Only when an area has been put under quarantine by the authorities, persons from this area may no longer enter HHU campus.  
  * The official welcome address for first-year students by the HHU President and the Vice President for the Quality in Studies will take place on 02 November 2020 in the context of an [online welcome event for first-year students](https://hhu.expo-ip.com/).
  * Please observe the specifications regarding the organisation of on-campus courses at HHU for students and lecturers for winter semester 2020/2021 (as of: 12 October 2020) [[Download PDF](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Handreichung_Lehre_WS2021_21.10.2020_01.pdf)].
  * For written exams, which are set to take place in October 2020 but which are written in connection with a course that took place in summer semester 2020, the regulations regarding an additional attempt to pass apply.   
  * In order to quickly identify and contact any contact persons in the event of a COVID-19 infection, it is mandatory to maintain a list of all attendees of on-campus courses. This is why students must leave their names, student registration number and telephone number when attending an on-campus event.   
  * From 26 October on, the main canteen (‚Mensa‘) will be open daily from 11:30am – 2pm and offer a limited choice of meals. If you wish to eat there you must book a seat up to 48 hours in advance via [the Studierendenwerk website](https://www.stw-d.de/).

## [ General information ](for-students.html#)

## General information

[Last updated: 30 October 2020]

To protect individual health and prevent further infections, Heinrich Heine
University is taking the following preventive measures. These measures apply
irrespective of whether initial symptoms of the disease have already been
detected.

  1. A simple face covering must be worn everywhere on HHU campus as well as all inside all buildings used by HHU. The only exceptions are for lecturers during their lectures, provided that the minimum distance of 1.5m to other persons can be maintained, and for employees in their own workspace, provided that the required hygiene measures (e.g. a minimum distance of 1.5m to other persons or separation by (acrylic) glass) can be maintained there. Further specifications for the health care sector must be observed. Persons who cannot wear a face covering for medical reasons are exempt from the obligation to wear one. To prove this, they need a medical certificate which they must carry on their person at all times. 
  2. Students who are infected with SARS-Co-V-2 are not allowed to enter HHU (premises and buildings) until it has been proven that the disease has been cured or is no longer contagious.
  3. Provided that a stay-at-home order is mandatorily required by the public health office or the general regulations of the state of NRW, a ban from entering the campus is in place for students who have entered from an international high-risk area that has been designated as such by the Federal Government as well as for students who were or still are in close contact with persons infected with the coronavirus because they, e.g., are taking care of them or live with them in a common household. Compliance with further specifications, for example, in UKD in the health care sector, must be ensured.
  4. Persons from areas within Germany that experience an increased number of coronavirus infections, and which sometimes are misleadingly called ‚risk areas‘, may still come to HHU. Only when an area has been put under quarantine by the authorities, persons from this area may no longer enter HHU campus.  

[Click here for more information about the latest hygiene and safety
regulations on the ‘corona website’](covid-19-suspected-and-confirmed-cases-
hygiene-policy.html).

Please also observe the [ specifications regarding the organisation of on-
campus courses at HHU for students and lecturers in winter semester
2020/2021](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Handreichung_Lehre_WS2021_21.10.2020_01.pdf)
(as of: 21 October 2020).

To be able to quickly identify and contact any contact persons in case of a
COVID-19 infection, traceability must be ensured in all in-person events
(lectures, examinations, exam reviews, office hours etc.). This is why you
will be asked to leave your name, your student registration number and your
telephone number in all of the events. The data will be stored securely for
four weeks to prevent unauthorised access and either be passed on to the
appropriate authorities should this become necessary or destroyed after four
weeks.

## [ Teaching and studying ](for-students.html#)

## Teaching and studying

[Last updated: 22 October 2020]

Winter semester 2020/2021 at HHU will be a hybrid semester comprised of in-
person and online teaching. In-person, on-campus teaching will take place to
the extent that responsible handling of the coronavirus is ensured. Courses
for first-year and international students take priority to give them the
opportunity to get to know the University and meet their fellow students.
However, in light of the current framework conditions, most of the courses
offered will take place online. 

At the end of summer semester 2020, HHU conducted a survey among all students
and lecturers asking them about their experiences in connection with the
online semester. The [results](https://www.mitarbeiter.hhu.de/intranet-
aktuell/aktuelle-meldungen-intranet/news-detail/article/die-umstellung-auf-
digitale-lehre-hat-ganz-gut-geklappt.html) (log-in with your uni ID) have been
included in the planning for winter semester 2020/2021.

#### **In-person, classroom teaching**

In-person teaching will take place in accordance with the Corona Pandemic
Ordinance and the General Direction of the State of NRW. As a rule, HHU will
observe the minimum distance of 1.5m for all on-campus formats. In addition to
that, a maximum number of 50 persons may attend on-campus events, provided the
room size allows for that number of participants. Only in a few exceptional
cases, where students are taught in the same small group throughout the
semester, can the minimum distance be disregarded. Courses such as laboratory
practicals or bedside teaching which mandatorily require physical presence and
are held in special rooms will also be conducted in-person as far as possible
and taking protection against infection into account. 

Together with the ‚Task Force Lehre‘, the Rectorate has looked into the
framework conditions and possibilities regarding in-person teaching during
winter semester 2020/2021 in detail and developed specifications for the
organisation of on-campus teachings at HHU. These specifications have been
adopted by the Rectorate and provide the framework for the organisation of in-
person teaching during winter semester 2020/2021 at HHU:

[ Specifications regarding the organisation of on-campus teaching for students
and lecturers in winter semester 2020/2021 at
HHU](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Handreichung_Lehre_WS2021_21.10.2020_01.pdf)
(as of: 21 October 2020).

These organisation specifications with be updated regularly and adapted in
accordance with the changing threat situation in connection with the Covid-19
pandemic. You can find the latest version of this document on this website. 

The traceability of all participants in case of infection must be guaranteed
for all on-campus courses and events (lectures, personal consultations,
examinations, etc.) as stipulated by the Corona Pandemic Ordinance. To that
aim, the lecturers will note down the contact details (name, matriculation
number, telephone number) of all participants for on-campus lectures. They can
use [ this
form](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Vordruck_Rueckverfolgbarkeit_v4.pdf).
The corresponding [ data protection information can be downloaded
here](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Informationsblatt_Datenschutzhinweise_Kontaktnachverfolgung_2020-10-13_GB.pdf).

#### **Online teaching**

Due to limited room resources, most courses will have to be held in digital
format only again. In order to enable students who for various reasons are
unable to attend in-person courses completely or temporarily to generally
participate in the courses, teachers should also offer all classroom-based,
in-person courses online. Exceptions to this rule are events whose specific
nature mandatorily requires physical presence.

To foster interaction between participants in courses, teachers were asked to
at least offer their digital course live in phases, if this was not already
the case in the summer semester. Following feedback from summer semester,
access to HHU’s systems was optimised so that the systems are efficiently set
up for the winter semester. Students can also find details of the courses and
modes offered in winter semester in HIS LSF and on the relevant subjects’
websites.

## [ Study rooms on campus ](for-students.html#)

[New: 30 October 2020]

In the context of the ‚hybrid‘ winter semester, which consists of on-campus as
well as online teaching, HHU provides study rooms on campus for its students.
These rooms are intended for those students who attend on-campus classes and
who wish to take part in an online class before or after the on-campus class.
More rooms can be made available should the demand exceed the number of rooms
currently offered. Please check this site regularly for the latest
information. You can find out more about the terms of use below in the
respective sections. 

#### Small study rooms

From 02 November 2020 on, small study rooms are available for individual use
on HHU’s campus. These small study rooms are primarily intended for
participation in online classes which require active involvement such as
taking an active part in a discussion. 

These small study rooms are open Monday – Friday from 10.30am to 6pm and can
be booked via a web application for an allocated time slot. This web
application will go online on 02 November at the latest and can be accessed
[via this link](https://www.philo.hhu.de/en/studium-und-
lehre/lehre/allgemeine-informationen/raumbuchungen).

It is in the uses’ responsibility to abide by these terms of use.These
include, besides the [ general rules of
behaviour](https://www.corona.hhu.de/en/covid-19-suspected-and-confirmed-
cases-hygiene-policy), single-person occupancy of the study rooms. Should it
become obvious that the study rooms are used by groups or that the terms of
use are violated in any other way, we will be forced to end this offer. 

#### Lecture theatres as a place to study

From 04 November 2020 on, a lecture theatre will be made available as a place
to study, from Monday – Thursday, 10:30am – 4pm:

  * Monday: lecture theatre 3D in building 23.01
  * Tuesday: Substitute lecture theatre in building 16.12
  * Wednesday: lecture theatre 5D in building 25.21
  * Thursday: lecture theatre 2D in building 22.01

Please note that 04 November, when this offer becomes available, is a
Wednesday which means that during that week only on Wednesday and Thursday
lecture theatres are available to study. 

In these lecture theatres, students can study in single-use workspaces or
follow online classes which require only passive or silent participation. The
use of other, unoccupied, lecture theatres as a place to study in is not
permitted. 

You do not need to book a seat in advance in order to use one of the
workspaces in the lecture theatre. You simply report to the invigilator at the
entrance of the lecture theatre who will then take your contact details  \-
please print out and [ fill in this
form](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Vordruck_Rueckverfolgbarkeit_v4.pdf)
and bring it with you. Only a limited number of persons can be admitted to a
single lecture theatre. For as long as there are workspaces available you will
be admitted after you have left your contact details at the entrance. The
available workspaces are marked as such, please use only those seats. 

Please bring your own end devices (notebook, tablet, etc.) and (if necessary)
headphones. Online classes with sound may only be followed while wearing
headphones in order to reduce the background noise in the lecture theatre to
an absolute minimum. 

It is in the users’ responsibility to comply with the terms of use. They
include the [ general rules of
behaviour](https://www.corona.hhu.de/en/covid-19-suspected-and-confirmed-
cases-hygiene-policy)but also the obligation to behave quietly so as not to
disturb your fellow students. The invigilators will monitor compliance with
these rules. 

Should these rules be violated we will be forced to end this offer.

## Exams

[Last updated: 14 September 2020]

#### General regulations

HHU’s rectorate has adopted regulations for the implementation of the
Coronavirus Epidemic University Directive (CEHVO).

  * [ HHU’s regulations of 7 May 2020](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Amtliche_Bekanntmachungen_im_Kontext_Corona/Amtliche-Bekanntmachungen_2020_05_07_AB_26.pdf)
  * [ First amendment to regulations dated 21 August 2020](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Amtliche_Bekanntmachungen_im_Kontext_Corona/Amtliche-Bekanntmachungen_2020_08_21_AB_42.pdf)
  * [ Second amendment to regulations dated 02 September 2020](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Amtliche_Bekanntmachungen_im_Kontext_Corona/Amtliche-Bekanntmachungen_2020_09_11_AB_44.pdf)
  * The regulations cover, in particular, aspects such as flexible teaching and exam formats, cancellation policies, free exam attempts or resit options, extension of the prescribed period of study during the corona pandemic. These regulations have been in force since 7 May 2020 and apply to the Bachelor’s and Master’s study programmes at HHU until further notice, provided that no deviating regulations were made in the examination regulations.

### Written exams

Exam periods during the summer semester must be extended due to limited
lecture hall capacities. Please inform yourself about the dates for written
exams, the applicable registration and deregistration regulations for exams
for summer semester 2020 on the websites of the subject(s) you are studying,
in the student portal and on the faculties’ websites. If you have any
questions, please contact the responsible dean’s  
offices of studies by e-mail.

During in-person exams, [ HHU’s hygiene concept
regulations](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Hygienekonzept/Unterweisung_Schutzmassnahmen_Coronavirus_SAUS_2020-05-04__1__ENG.pdf)
must be complied with. Your lecturers will inform you before the exam about
any possible further hygiene measures. Please familiarise yourself with the
regulations and procedures – compliance with them is compulsory.

In exceptional cases, written exams can be taken online, provided the
appropriate examination regulations allow for this. Your lecturers will be
able to inform you about the appropriate processes and regulations.

Until further notice, the failure to appear for an exam counts as a
permissible withdrawal from the exam, provided the appropriate examination
regulations allow for this. In case of questions, please contact your dean of
studies' office or the appropriate examinations committee. 

### Viewing exam papers

Exam papers can be viewed if the general hygiene regulations are observed.
Please arrange a date with your lecturer. Please [click this link for
recommendations on how to view exam papers during the coronavirus
pandemic](https://www.math-nat-
fak.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Fakultaeten/Mathematisch-
Naturwissenschaftliche_Fakultaet/Dekanat/Dokumente/MNF-
Empfehlungen_zur_Durchfuehrung_von_Klausureinsichten.pdf).

### Oral exams

Oral exams can be taken in person on campus, provided all of HHU’s hygiene and
safety regulations are observed throughout. 

Individual oral exams can currently be carried out as an online video
conference in so far as they are permitted by the applicable examination
regulations. The examiner decides for each application whether an oral exam
can be offered as an online video conference. Students must make the
applications and provide reasons for the application. Certain requirements
must also be met; please [refer to HHU’s online exam
guidelines](https://www.philo.hhu.de/studium-und-lehre/lehre/leitfaden-zur-
durchfuehrung-von-online-videopruefungen.html) for more information.

 Students may withdraw from an oral examination until noon of the day before
the examination. To withdraw from an exam, students can contact the examiner
directly. In case of an acute illness, students may withdraw from the exam
until the beginning of the exam if they can provide a doctor’s certificate.  

### Regulations regarding free exam attempts and examination resits

Bachelor’s and Master’s degree students at HHU will get one additional
opportunity to resit a failed module exam in summer semester 2020. This
provision applies only once for each module exam and is effective irrespective
of the number of attempts to pass the exam the student has already had.  For
written exams which are set to take place in October 2020 but which are
written in connection with a course that took place in summer semester 2020,
the regulations regarding an additional attempt to pass apply. 

Please note the following for students of the state examination courses of the
Faculty of Law: in accordance with section 25 (1) (1) of the JAG NRW, summer
semester 2020 will not be considered in the calculation of the number of
semesters for the free exam attempt. Any academic achievements can, however,
be still be credited. For more details, please [see the letter by the Judicial
Examination Office (Justizprüfungsamt)](https://olg-
duesseldorf.nrw.de/aufgaben/pruefungsamt/Hinweis-Freiversuch-_Stand-19_) as of
19 May 2020.

The state examination degree courses in human medicine and dentistry are
exempt from the above mentioned free exam attempts and examination resits.

[Updated on: 02 October 2020]

### Enrolment and re-registration

In order to enrol for a course you must have enrolled or re-registered as a
full-time student.

Students can enrol, re-register or change subjects by sending the documents by
post. It is not necessary for students to enrol or re-register in person. It
is currently also possible to determine suitability for switching subjects on
a master’s programme by e-mail. Please [click on this link for information on
applications](https://www.uni-duesseldorf.de/home/en/studying-and-teaching-at-
hhu/studying/erste-schritte-nuetzliches-bewerbung-und-
einschreibung/information-for-foreign-applicants/application-as-a-foreign-
student.html).

If you have any questions, please contact the Student Services hotline at
0211-8112345 or send an . You can find out more about responsibilities in the
[OnSSC](https://www.uni-duesseldorf.de/home/studium-und-lehre-an-der-
hhu/studium/studienberatung2/onssc.html).

### Prescribed period of study

Summer semester 2020 is not counted as a programme-related semester. Exempt
from this rule are courses of study with final exams set by the state if the
regulations provided by the state allow for the extension of the prescribed
period of study by one semester. The regulation is implemented in such a way
that the student’s individual prescribed period of study is one semester
longer than the general, prescribed period of study as stipulated in the
currently valid examination regulations.

These regulations were adjusted on 02 September 2020 to comply with the
respective NRW legislation. Students who have suffered disadvantages due to
the increase of the individual prescribed period of study by one semester (as
opposed to not counting the semester as previously announced) can
retroactively apply for leave of absence for summer semester 2020 due to
“other important reasons” (“sonstige wichtige Gründe”).  Students are asked to
contact HHU Registrar’s Office (Studierenden- und Prüfungsverwaltung) for more
information.

### Periods of study abroad

Erasmus stays abroad can go ahead as planned from winter semester 2020/21 on
provided that the host university remains open to exchange students. A mix of
digital and in-person lectures is possible here. At this point in time, it is
not fully clear yet if fully digital semesters can be sponsored. You will only
receive financial support for periods where you stayed abroad, no matter
whether you use only digital or in-person teaching offers. As long as you are
taking courses digitally from Germany, the International Office is not allowed
to support this financially.

A stay abroad is possible and eligible for financial support even if the
German Federal Foreign Office has issued a travel warning. However, the
International Office expressly points out that health and safety are naturally
top priorities in the Erasmus+ programme, too. The German Academic Exchange
Service (DAAD) therefore advises against staying in a high-risk area. Please
refer to the travel warnings for tourist travel that the [German Federal
Foreign Office](https://www.auswaertiges-
amt.de/de/ReiseUndSicherheit/covid-19/2296762) updates on a regular basis.
When returning from a high-risk area, please observe the [RKI’s applicable
regulations](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/nCoV.html)
regarding quarantine and/or testing.

If they wish, students may postpone their semester abroad intended to take
place during winter semester 2020/21 and do it in summer semester 2021.
However, they have to get permission from the Erasmus officer in their
respective subject and the host university. They also have to notify HHU’s
International Office. They should also bear in mind that summer semesters in
other countries often begin as early as January or February (and can therefore
collide with the end of HHU’s winter semester). 

In the light of the current situation, the International Office recommends
that you do not pay any travel expenses or transfer rent/rental deposits too
far in advance.  If you cannot start your stay abroad at short notice due to
measures against the spread of the coronavirus and you have already incurred
costs, the International Office may be able to take over some of the costs.

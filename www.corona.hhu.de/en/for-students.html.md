## Information for HHU students

This website provides you with regularly updated information on general
regulations. You will receive further information by e-mail. In addition, we
recommend that you find out about the faculty-specific measures or course-
specific measures on the websites for your faculty and your study programme
and that you check your HHU e-mail account on regular basis.

## Main points for students in brief

  * From 02 December on, in accordance with the new General Decree passed by the State of NRW, on-campus activities are no longer permitted until further notice. **Teaching will exclusively take place online.** One exception are classes and on-campus events where personal attendance is vital because the participants depend on special rooms (such as laboratories) or other special framework conditions (e.g. bedside teaching). Another exception are courses for first-year students in bachelor’s and state examination study programmes that have already started. In accordance with the previous regulations, examinations can still take place. Access to the library remains as is.
  * A simple face covering must be worn everywhere on HHU campus as well as all inside all buildings used by HHU. The only exceptions are for lecturers during their lectures, provided that the minimum distance of 1.5m to other persons can be maintained, and for employees in their own workspace, provided that the required hygiene measures (e.g. a minimum distance of 1.5m to other persons or separation by (acrylic) glass) can be maintained there.   
  * Persons who are required to undergo a period of self-isolation as stipulated in the General Regulations of the State of NRW must not enter HHU campus.
  * Persons from areas within Germany with a high number of coronavirus infections, and which sometimes are misleadingly called ‚risk areas‘, may still come to HHU. Only when an area has been put under quarantine by the authorities, persons from this area may no longer enter HHU campus.  
  * New students at HHU are asked to activate their uni ID as soon as possible. [This link will tell you how](https://www.zim.hhu.de/ankommen-im-studium/online-aktivierung-der-unikennung.html). For the activation you will need your student registration number and the initial password that gets sent to you by post. In case you haven’t received your uni Id yet, please contact student services [Link: ].
  * From 02 November 2020 on, there will be study rooms available on campus for the students. They are intended for those students who are on campus to attend an on-campus class and who wish to participate in one of the online activities before or after the on-campus class. You can find terms of use below under the topic ‘study rooms on campus’.  
  * From 26 October on, the main canteen (‚Mensa‘) will be open daily from 11:30am – 2pm and offer a limited choice of meals. If you wish to eat there you must book a seat up to 48 hours in advance via [the Studierendenwerk website](https://www.stw-d.de/).

## [ General information ](for-students.html#)

## General information

[Last updated: 02 December 2020]

To protect individual health and prevent further infections, Heinrich Heine
University is taking the following preventive measures. These measures apply
irrespective of whether initial symptoms of the disease have already been
detected.

  1. A simple face covering must be worn everywhere on HHU campus as well as all inside all buildings used by HHU. The only exceptions are for lecturers during their lectures, provided that the minimum distance of 1.5m to other persons can be maintained, and for employees in their own workspace, provided that the required hygiene measures (e.g. a minimum distance of 1.5m to other persons or separation by (acrylic) glass) can be maintained there. Further specifications for the health care sector must be observed. Persons who cannot wear a face covering for medical reasons are exempt from the obligation to wear one. To prove this, they need a medical certificate which they must carry on their person at all times. 
  2. Students who are infected with SARS-Co-V-2 are not allowed to enter HHU (premises and buildings) until it has been proven that the disease has been cured or is no longer contagious.
  3. Provided that a stay-at-home order is mandatorily required by the public health office or the general regulations of the state of NRW, a ban from entering the campus is in place for students who have entered from an international high-risk area that has been designated as such by the Federal Government as well as for students who were or still are in close contact with persons infected with the coronavirus because they, e.g., are taking care of them or live with them in a common household. Compliance with further specifications, for example, in UKD in the health care sector, must be ensured.
  4. Persons from areas within Germany that experience an increased number of coronavirus infections, and which sometimes are misleadingly called ‚risk areas‘, may still come to HHU. Only when an area has been put under quarantine by the authorities, persons from this area may no longer enter HHU campus.  

[Click here for more information about the latest hygiene and safety
regulations on the ‘corona website’](covid-19-suspected-and-confirmed-cases-
hygiene-policy.html).

To be able to quickly identify and contact any contact persons in case of a
COVID-19 infection, traceability must be ensured in all in-person events
(lectures, examinations, exam reviews, office hours etc.). This is why you
will be asked to leave your name, your student registration number and your
telephone number in all of the events. The data will be stored securely for
four weeks to prevent unauthorised access and either be passed on to the
appropriate authorities should this become necessary or destroyed after four
weeks. 

## [ Dates & Deadlines ](for-students.html#)

## Dates & Deadlines

[Last updated: 02 November 2020]

The start of the lecture period for winter semester 2020/2021 has been

## [ Teaching and studying ](for-students.html#)

## Teaching and studying

[Last updated: 02 December 2020]

The latest General Decree passed by the State of NRW on teaching, practical
activities and examinations at higher education institutions introduces
restrictions concerning teaching operations and examinations. With regard to
teaching operations this means: 

From 02 December on, all teaching activities will take place online. The only
exception are classes and on-campus activities where personal attendance is
vital because the participants depend on special facilities (e.g.
laboratories) or other special framework conditions (e.g. bedside teaching).
Another exception are courses for first-year students in bachelor’s and state
examination programmes that have already started and which were designed to be
on-campus or hybrid courses.  

For information regarding the adjustments to your courses contact your
lecturers, or check the learning platforms ILIAS and Moodle. All communication
will take place via your university e-mail address. Please contact your
lecturer in case of questions regarding a specific class. 

For tips and tricks regarding digital teaching click this link [Link:
<https://www.hhu.de/lehre/tipps-und-tricks-fuer-das-digitale-studium>].

Persons participating in on-campus events must wear a face covering. The only
exception are lecturers if they can maintain the required minimum distance to
other persons in the room. During all activities, the relevant hygiene and
safety rules must be observed. In case of all in-person events, adequate
contact tracing in case of infection must be guaranteed. [ This form will help
you collect the contact details of the
participants](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Vordruck_Rueckverfolgbarkeit_v4.pdf).

## [ Study rooms on campus ](for-students.html#)

[New: 02 December 2020]

#### Small study rooms

From 02 November 2020 on, small study rooms are available for HHU students.
These small study rooms may only be used by one person at a time (single
occupancy) and are primarily intended for participation in online classes
which require active involvement such as taking an active part in a
discussion. It is the users’ responsibility to abide by the terms of use.
These include, besides the [ general rules of
behaviour](https://www.corona.hhu.de/en/covid-19-suspected-and-confirmed-
cases-hygiene-policy) the obligation to respect the single-person occupancy
rule. It is not permitted to use these rooms as a group or for purposes other
than the participation in online courses. Spaces that are intended exclusively
for studying are available in the library. HHU’s security contractor will make
sure that these rules are obeyed. Should it become apparent that the rooms are
used by groups or that the terms or use are violated in any other way, we will
be forced to discontinue this service. 

These small study rooms are open Monday – Friday from 10.30am to 6pm. The
rooms in building 23.02 are available from 8am – 6pm. The small study rooms
can be booked [via a web application](https://www.philo.hhu.de/en/studium-und-
lehre/lehre/allgemeine-informationen/raumbuchungen) for an allocated time slot
at a time. It is mandatory to book a space in advance.

#### Lecture theatres as a place to study

Lecture theatres remain closed until further notice.

#### General regulations

HHU’s rectorate has adopted regulations for the implementation of the
Coronavirus Epidemic University Directive (CEHVO).

  * [ HHU’s regulations of 7 May 2020](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Amtliche_Bekanntmachungen_im_Kontext_Corona/Amtliche-Bekanntmachungen_2020_05_07_AB_26.pdf)
  * [ First amendment to regulations dated 21 August 2020](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Amtliche_Bekanntmachungen_im_Kontext_Corona/Amtliche-Bekanntmachungen_2020_08_21_AB_42.pdf)
  * [ Second amendment to regulations dated 02 September 2020](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Amtliche_Bekanntmachungen_im_Kontext_Corona/Amtliche-Bekanntmachungen_2020_09_11_AB_44.pdf)
  * The regulations cover, in particular, aspects such as flexible teaching and exam formats, cancellation policies, free exam attempts or resit options, extension of the prescribed period of study during the corona pandemic. These regulations have been in force since 7 May 2020 and apply to the Bachelor’s and Master’s study programmes at HHU until further notice, provided that no deviating regulations were made in the examination regulations.

#### Written exams and viewing of exam papers

Please inform yourself about the dates for written exams, exam regulations and
the applicable registration and deregistration regulations for exams on the
websites of the subject(s) you are studying, in the student portal and on the
faculties’ websites. If you have any questions, please contact the responsible
dean of studies’ office by e-mail.

During on-campus exams as well as the viewing of exam papers, [ HHU’s hygiene
concept
regulations](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Hygienekonzept/Unterweisung_Schutzmassnahmen_Coronavirus_SAUS_2020-05-04__1__ENG.pdf)
must be complied with. Your lecturers will inform you before the exam about
any possible further hygiene measures. Please familiarise yourself with the
regulations and procedures – compliance with them is compulsory.

In exceptional cases, written exams can be taken online, provided the
appropriate examination regulations allow for this. Your lecturers will be
able to inform you about the appropriate processes and regulations.

Until further notice, the failure to appear for an exam counts as a
permissible withdrawal from the exam, provided the appropriate examination
regulations allow for this. In case of questions, please contact your dean of
studies' office or the appropriate examinations committee.

### Oral exams

Oral exams can be taken in person on campus, provided all of HHU’s hygiene and
safety regulations are observed throughout. 

Individual oral exams can currently be carried out as an online video
conference in so far as they are permitted by the applicable examination
regulations. The examiner decides for each application whether an oral exam
can be offered as an online video conference. Students must make the
applications and provide reasons for the application. Certain requirements
must also be met; please [refer to HHU’s online exam
guidelines](https://www.philo.hhu.de/studium-und-lehre/lehre/leitfaden-zur-
durchfuehrung-von-online-videopruefungen.html) for more information.

 Students may withdraw from an oral examination until noon of the day before
the examination. To withdraw from an exam, students can contact the examiner
directly. In case of an acute illness, students may withdraw from the exam
until the beginning of the exam if they can provide a doctor’s certificate.

### Enrolment and re-registration

In order to enrol for a course you must have enrolled or re-registered as a
full-time student.

Students can enrol, re-register or change subjects by sending the documents by
post. It is not necessary for students to enrol or re-register in person. It
is currently also possible to determine suitability for switching subjects on
a master’s programme by e-mail. Please [click on this link for information on
applications](https://www.uni-duesseldorf.de/home/en/studying-and-teaching-at-
hhu/studying/erste-schritte-nuetzliches-bewerbung-und-
einschreibung/information-for-foreign-applicants/application-as-a-foreign-
student.html).

If you have any questions, please contact the Student Services hotline at
0211-8112345 or send an . You can find out more about responsibilities in the
[OnSSC](https://www.uni-duesseldorf.de/home/studium-und-lehre-an-der-
hhu/studium/studienberatung2/onssc.html).

### Periods of study abroad

Erasmus stays abroad can go ahead as planned provided that the host university
remains open to exchange students. A mix of digital and in-person lectures is
possible here. At this point in time, it is not fully clear yet if fully
digital semesters can be sponsored. You will only receive financial support
for periods where you stayed abroad, no matter whether you use only digital or
in-person teaching offers. As long as you are taking courses digitally from
Germany, the International Office is not allowed to support this financially.

A stay abroad is possible and eligible for financial support even if the
German Federal Foreign Office has issued a travel warning. However, the
International Office expressly points out that health and safety are naturally
top priorities in the Erasmus+ programme, too. The German Academic Exchange
Service (DAAD) therefore advises against staying in a high-risk area. Please
refer to the travel warnings for tourist travel that the [German Federal
Foreign Office](https://www.auswaertiges-
amt.de/de/ReiseUndSicherheit/covid-19/2296762) updates on a regular basis.
When returning from a high-risk area, please observe the [RKI’s applicable
regulations](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/nCoV.html)
regarding quarantine and/or testing.

If they wish, students may postpone their semester abroad intended to take
place during winter semester 2020/21 and do it in summer semester 2021.
However, they have to get permission from the Erasmus officer in their
respective subject and the host university. They also have to notify HHU’s
International Office. They should also bear in mind that summer semesters in
other countries often begin as early as January or February (and can therefore
collide with the end of HHU’s winter semester). 

In the light of the current situation, the International Office recommends
that you do not pay any travel expenses or transfer rent/rental deposits too
far in advance.  If you cannot start your stay abroad at short notice due to
measures against the spread of the coronavirus and you have already incurred
costs, the International Office may be able to take over some of the costs.

Please contact  if you have any questions.

The same basically applies to students who receive an HHU Mobility Grant /
PROMOS. However, students who want to postphone their stay abroad until the
summer semester must re-apply for a scholarship by 01 November 2020 because
the scholarships are granted by calendar year only. Please contact  in case of
any questions.

## [ Information for international students ](for-students.html#)

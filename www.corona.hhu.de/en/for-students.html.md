## Information for HHU students

This website provides you with regularly updated information on general
regulations. You will receive further information by e-mail. In addition, we
recommend that you find out about the faculty-specific measures or course-
specific measures on the websites for your faculty and your study programme
and that you check your HHU e-mail account on regular basis.

## Main points for students in brief

  * A simple face covering must be worn everywhere on HHU campus as well as all inside all buildings used by HHU. The only exceptions are for lecturers during their lectures, provided that the minimum distance of 1.5m to other persons can be maintained, and for employees in their own workspace, provided that the required hygiene measures (e.g. a minimum distance of 1.5m to other persons or separation by (acrylic) glass) can be maintained there.   
  * Persons who are required to undergo a period of self-isolation as stipulated in the General Regulations of the State of NRW must not enter HHU campus.
  * Persons from areas within Germany with a high number of coronavirus infections, and which sometimes are misleadingly called ‚risk areas‘, may still come to HHU. Only when an area has been put under quarantine by the authorities, persons from this area may no longer enter HHU campus.  
  * Please observe the specifications regarding the organisation of on-campus courses at HHU for students and lecturers for winter semester 2020/2021 (as of: 21 October 2020) [[Download PDF](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Handreichung_Lehre_WS2021_21.10.2020_01.pdf)].
  * From 02 November 2020 on, there will be study rooms available on campus for the students. They are intended for those students who are on campus to attend an on-campus class and who wish to participate in one of the online activities before or after the on-campus class. You can find terms of use below under the topic ‘study rooms on campus’.  
  * From 26 October on, the main canteen (‚Mensa‘) will be open daily from 11:30am – 2pm and offer a limited choice of meals. If you wish to eat there you must book a seat up to 48 hours in advance via [the Studierendenwerk website](https://www.stw-d.de/).

## [ General information ](for-students.html#)

## General information

[Last updated: 30 October 2020]

To protect individual health and prevent further infections, Heinrich Heine
University is taking the following preventive measures. These measures apply
irrespective of whether initial symptoms of the disease have already been
detected.

  1. A simple face covering must be worn everywhere on HHU campus as well as all inside all buildings used by HHU. The only exceptions are for lecturers during their lectures, provided that the minimum distance of 1.5m to other persons can be maintained, and for employees in their own workspace, provided that the required hygiene measures (e.g. a minimum distance of 1.5m to other persons or separation by (acrylic) glass) can be maintained there. Further specifications for the health care sector must be observed. Persons who cannot wear a face covering for medical reasons are exempt from the obligation to wear one. To prove this, they need a medical certificate which they must carry on their person at all times. 
  2. Students who are infected with SARS-Co-V-2 are not allowed to enter HHU (premises and buildings) until it has been proven that the disease has been cured or is no longer contagious.
  3. Provided that a stay-at-home order is mandatorily required by the public health office or the general regulations of the state of NRW, a ban from entering the campus is in place for students who have entered from an international high-risk area that has been designated as such by the Federal Government as well as for students who were or still are in close contact with persons infected with the coronavirus because they, e.g., are taking care of them or live with them in a common household. Compliance with further specifications, for example, in UKD in the health care sector, must be ensured.
  4. Persons from areas within Germany that experience an increased number of coronavirus infections, and which sometimes are misleadingly called ‚risk areas‘, may still come to HHU. Only when an area has been put under quarantine by the authorities, persons from this area may no longer enter HHU campus.  

[Click here for more information about the latest hygiene and safety
regulations on the ‘corona website’](covid-19-suspected-and-confirmed-cases-
hygiene-policy.html).

Please also observe the [ specifications regarding the organisation of on-
campus courses at HHU for students and lecturers in winter semester
2020/2021](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Handreichung_Lehre_WS2021_21.10.2020_01.pdf)
(as of: 03 November 2020).

To be able to quickly identify and contact any contact persons in case of a
COVID-19 infection, traceability must be ensured in all in-person events
(lectures, examinations, exam reviews, office hours etc.). This is why you
will be asked to leave your name, your student registration number and your
telephone number in all of the events. The data will be stored securely for
four weeks to prevent unauthorised access and either be passed on to the
appropriate authorities should this become necessary or destroyed after four
weeks. 

## [ Dates & Deadlines ](for-students.html#)

## Teaching and studying

[Last updated: 04 November 2020]

Winter semester 2020/2021 at HHU will be a hybrid semester comprised of in-
person and online teaching. It is important for you to stay informed about any
changes concerning your courses or regarding teaching. To do this, please read
the information on HHU’s corona website and the website of your subject and
check your university e-mail account regularly. New students at HHU are asked
to activate their uni ID as soon as possible. [This link will tell you
how](https://www.zim.hhu.de/en/services-des-zim/uni-kennung/aktivierung-ihrer-
uni-kennung-und-hhu-card). For the activation you will need your student
registration number and the initial password that gets sent to you by post. In
case you haven’t received your uni Id yet, please . 

#### In-person, classroom teaching

You can usually find information about courses/lectures that take place on-
campus on the learning platforms ILIAS and Moodle and you can also get it from
your lecturers. The corresponding communication will take place via your
university e-mail address.

HHU has defined a framework and established procedures for on-campus courses
this winter semester. Find the relevant version of the procedures in place
here:

[ Specifications regarding the organisation of on-campus teaching for students
and lecturers in winter semester 2020/2021 at
HHU](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Handreichung_Lehre_WS2021_21.10.2020_01.pdf)
(as of: 21 October 2020).

The traceability of all participants in case of infection must be guaranteed
for all on-campus courses and events (lectures, personal consultations,
examinations, etc.) as stipulated by the Corona Pandemic Ordinance. To that
aim, the lecturers will note down your contact details (name, matriculation
number, telephone number). They can use [ this
form](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Vordruck_Rueckverfolgbarkeit_v4.pdf).

#### Online teaching

Most of the courses this winter semester will be virtual. We have compiled a
few [tips for successfully studying
online](https://www.hhu.de/en/studium/studienorganisation/digital).

## [ Study rooms on campus ](for-students.html#)

[New: 02 November 2020]

In the context of the ‚hybrid‘ winter semester, which consists of on-campus as
well as online teaching, HHU provides study rooms on campus for its students.
These rooms are intended for those students who attend on-campus classes and
who wish to take part in an online class before or after the on-campus class.
More rooms can be made available should the demand exceed the number of rooms
currently offered. Please check this site regularly for the latest
information. You can find out more about the terms of use below in the
respective sections. 

#### Small study rooms

From 02 November 2020 on, small study rooms are available for individual use
on HHU’s campus. These small study rooms are primarily intended for
participation in online classes which require active involvement such as
taking an active part in a discussion. 

These small study rooms are open Monday – Friday from 10.30am to 6pm and can
be booked via a web application for an allocated time slot.

It is in the uses’ responsibility to abide by these terms of use.These
include, besides the [ general rules of
behaviour](https://www.corona.hhu.de/en/covid-19-suspected-and-confirmed-
cases-hygiene-policy), single-person occupancy of the study rooms. Should it
become obvious that the study rooms are used by groups or that the terms of
use are violated in any other way, we will be forced to end this offer. 

#### Lecture theatres as a place to study

From 04 November 2020 on, a lecture theatre will be made available as a place
to study, from Monday – Thursday, 10:30am – 4.30pm:

  * Monday: lecture theatre 3D in building 23.01
  * Tuesday: Substitute lecture theatre in building 16.12
  * Wednesday: lecture theatre 5D in building 25.21
  * Thursday: lecture theatre 2D in building 22.01

Please note that 04 November, when this offer becomes available, is a
Wednesday which means that during that week only on Wednesday and Thursday
lecture theatres are available to study. 

In these lecture theatres, students can study in single-use workspaces or
follow online classes which require only passive or silent participation. The
use of other, unoccupied, lecture theatres as a place to study in is not
permitted. 

You do not need to book a seat in advance in order to use one of the
workspaces in the lecture theatre. You simply report to the invigilator at the
entrance of the lecture theatre who will then take your contact details  \-
please print out and [ fill in this
form](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Vordruck_Rueckverfolgbarkeit_v4.pdf)
and bring it with you. Only a limited number of persons can be admitted to a
single lecture theatre. For as long as there are workspaces available you will
be admitted after you have left your contact details at the entrance. The
available workspaces are marked as such, please use only those seats. 

Please bring your own end devices (notebook, tablet, etc.) and (if necessary)
headphones. Online classes with sound may only be followed while wearing
headphones in order to reduce the background noise in the lecture theatre to
an absolute minimum. 

It is in the users’ responsibility to comply with the terms of use. They
include the [ general rules of
behaviour](https://www.corona.hhu.de/en/covid-19-suspected-and-confirmed-
cases-hygiene-policy)but also the obligation to behave quietly so as not to
disturb your fellow students. The invigilators will monitor compliance with
these rules. 

Should these rules be violated we will be forced to end this offer.

#### General regulations

HHU’s rectorate has adopted regulations for the implementation of the
Coronavirus Epidemic University Directive (CEHVO).

  * [ HHU’s regulations of 7 May 2020](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Amtliche_Bekanntmachungen_im_Kontext_Corona/Amtliche-Bekanntmachungen_2020_05_07_AB_26.pdf)
  * [ First amendment to regulations dated 21 August 2020](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Amtliche_Bekanntmachungen_im_Kontext_Corona/Amtliche-Bekanntmachungen_2020_08_21_AB_42.pdf)
  * [ Second amendment to regulations dated 02 September 2020](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Amtliche_Bekanntmachungen_im_Kontext_Corona/Amtliche-Bekanntmachungen_2020_09_11_AB_44.pdf)
  * The regulations cover, in particular, aspects such as flexible teaching and exam formats, cancellation policies, free exam attempts or resit options, extension of the prescribed period of study during the corona pandemic. These regulations have been in force since 7 May 2020 and apply to the Bachelor’s and Master’s study programmes at HHU until further notice, provided that no deviating regulations were made in the examination regulations.

#### Written exams and viewing of exam papers

Please inform yourself about the dates for written exams, exam regulations and
the applicable registration and deregistration regulations for exams on the
websites of the subject(s) you are studying, in the student portal and on the
faculties’ websites. If you have any questions, please contact the responsible
dean of studies’ office by e-mail.

During on-campus exams as well as the viewing of exam papers, [ HHU’s hygiene
concept
regulations](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Hygienekonzept/Unterweisung_Schutzmassnahmen_Coronavirus_SAUS_2020-05-04__1__ENG.pdf)
must be complied with. Your lecturers will inform you before the exam about
any possible further hygiene measures. Please familiarise yourself with the
regulations and procedures – compliance with them is compulsory.

In exceptional cases, written exams can be taken online, provided the
appropriate examination regulations allow for this. Your lecturers will be
able to inform you about the appropriate processes and regulations.

Until further notice, the failure to appear for an exam counts as a
permissible withdrawal from the exam, provided the appropriate examination
regulations allow for this. In case of questions, please contact your dean of
studies' office or the appropriate examinations committee.

### Oral exams

Oral exams can be taken in person on campus, provided all of HHU’s hygiene and
safety regulations are observed throughout. 

Individual oral exams can currently be carried out as an online video
conference in so far as they are permitted by the applicable examination
regulations. The examiner decides for each application whether an oral exam
can be offered as an online video conference. Students must make the
applications and provide reasons for the application. Certain requirements
must also be met; please [refer to HHU’s online exam
guidelines](https://www.philo.hhu.de/studium-und-lehre/lehre/leitfaden-zur-
durchfuehrung-von-online-videopruefungen.html) for more information.

 Students may withdraw from an oral examination until noon of the day before
the examination. To withdraw from an exam, students can contact the examiner
directly. In case of an acute illness, students may withdraw from the exam
until the beginning of the exam if they can provide a doctor’s certificate.

[Last updated 02 November 2020]

### Enrolment and re-registration

In order to enrol for a course you must have enrolled or re-registered as a
full-time student.

Students can enrol, re-register or change subjects by sending the documents by
post. It is not necessary for students to enrol or re-register in person. It
is currently also possible to determine suitability for switching subjects on
a master’s programme by e-mail. Please [click on this link for information on
applications](https://www.uni-duesseldorf.de/home/en/studying-and-teaching-at-
hhu/studying/erste-schritte-nuetzliches-bewerbung-und-
einschreibung/information-for-foreign-applicants/application-as-a-foreign-
student.html).

If you have any questions, please contact the Student Services hotline at
0211-8112345 or send an . You can find out more about responsibilities in the
[OnSSC](https://www.uni-duesseldorf.de/home/studium-und-lehre-an-der-
hhu/studium/studienberatung2/onssc.html).

### Periods of study abroad

Erasmus stays abroad can go ahead as planned provided that the host university
remains open to exchange students. A mix of digital and in-person lectures is
possible here. At this point in time, it is not fully clear yet if fully
digital semesters can be sponsored. You will only receive financial support
for periods where you stayed abroad, no matter whether you use only digital or
in-person teaching offers. As long as you are taking courses digitally from
Germany, the International Office is not allowed to support this financially.

A stay abroad is possible and eligible for financial support even if the
German Federal Foreign Office has issued a travel warning. However, the
International Office expressly points out that health and safety are naturally
top priorities in the Erasmus+ programme, too. The German Academic Exchange
Service (DAAD) therefore advises against staying in a high-risk area. Please
refer to the travel warnings for tourist travel that the [German Federal
Foreign Office](https://www.auswaertiges-
amt.de/de/ReiseUndSicherheit/covid-19/2296762) updates on a regular basis.
When returning from a high-risk area, please observe the [RKI’s applicable
regulations](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/nCoV.html)
regarding quarantine and/or testing.

If they wish, students may postpone their semester abroad intended to take
place during winter semester 2020/21 and do it in summer semester 2021.
However, they have to get permission from the Erasmus officer in their
respective subject and the host university. They also have to notify HHU’s
International Office. They should also bear in mind that summer semesters in
other countries often begin as early as January or February (and can therefore
collide with the end of HHU’s winter semester). 

In the light of the current situation, the International Office recommends
that you do not pay any travel expenses or transfer rent/rental deposits too
far in advance.  If you cannot start your stay abroad at short notice due to
measures against the spread of the coronavirus and you have already incurred
costs, the International Office may be able to take over some of the costs.

Please contact  if you have any questions.

The same basically applies to students who receive an HHU Mobility Grant /
PROMOS. However, students who want to postphone their stay abroad until the
summer semester must re-apply for a scholarship by 01 November 2020 because
the scholarships are granted by calendar year only. Please contact  in case of
any questions.

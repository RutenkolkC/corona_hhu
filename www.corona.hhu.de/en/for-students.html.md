## Information for HHU students

This website provides you with regularly updated information on general
regulations. You will receive further information by e-mail. In addition, we
recommend that you find out about the faculty-specific measures or course-
specific measures on the websites for your faculty and your study programme
and that you check your HHU e-mail account on regular basis.

## Main points for students in brief

  * In light of the latest developments surrounding coronavirus infections and in light of the NRW state government’s decisions, further restrictions on teaching and examinations at HHU are inevitable. For details, please see the sections “teaching and studying” and “examinations”.
  * The study rooms on campus that had been set up for participation in online courses closed on 16 December until further notice.
  * A simple face covering must be worn everywhere on HHU campus as well as all inside all buildings used by HHU. The only exceptions are for employees in their own workspace, provided that the required hygiene measures (e.g. a minimum distance of 1.5m to other persons or separation by (acrylic) glass) can be maintained there.   
  * Persons who are required to undergo a period of self-isolation as stipulated in the General Regulations of the State of NRW must not enter HHU campus.
  * The Studierendenwerk has announced that the main canteen (Mensa) at Universitätsstraße and all other canteens and cafés on HHU’s campus closed on 16 December until further notice. For more information, check the Studierendenwerk [website](https://www.stw-d.de) .
  * The rectorate has passed [ new regulations to specify the Corona Pandemic Ordinance](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/ZUV/Justitiariat/Amtliche_Bekanntmachungen/2020/2020_12_10_AB_66.pdf).   These regulations provide almost university-wide specifications regarding flexible teaching and examination formats, withdrawals from exams and additional attempts at passing examinations during the covid-19 pandemic.

## [ General information ](for-students.html#)

## General information

[Last updated: 02 December 2020]

To protect individual health and prevent further infections, Heinrich Heine
University is taking the following preventive measures. These measures apply
irrespective of whether initial symptoms of the disease have already been
detected.

  1. A simple face covering must be worn everywhere on HHU campus as well as all inside all buildings used by HHU. The only exceptions are for lecturers during their lectures, provided that the minimum distance of 1.5m to other persons can be maintained, and for employees in their own workspace, provided that the required hygiene measures (e.g. a minimum distance of 1.5m to other persons or separation by (acrylic) glass) can be maintained there. Further specifications for the health care sector must be observed. Persons who cannot wear a face covering for medical reasons are exempt from the obligation to wear one. To prove this, they need a medical certificate which they must carry on their person at all times. 
  2. Students who are infected with SARS-Co-V-2 are not allowed to enter HHU (premises and buildings) until it has been proven that the disease has been cured or is no longer contagious.
  3. Provided that a stay-at-home order is mandatorily required by the public health office or the general regulations of the state of NRW, a ban from entering the campus is in place for students who have entered from an international high-risk area that has been designated as such by the Federal Government as well as for students who were or still are in close contact with persons infected with the coronavirus because they, e.g., are taking care of them or live with them in a common household. Compliance with further specifications, for example, in UKD in the health care sector, must be ensured.
  4. Persons from areas within Germany that experience an increased number of coronavirus infections, and which sometimes are misleadingly called ‚risk areas‘, may still come to HHU. Only when an area has been put under quarantine by the authorities, persons from this area may no longer enter HHU campus.  

[Click here for more information about the latest hygiene and safety
regulations on the ‘corona website’](covid-19-suspected-and-confirmed-cases-
hygiene-policy.html).

To be able to quickly identify and contact any contact persons in case of a
COVID-19 infection, traceability must be ensured in all in-person events
(lectures, examinations, exam reviews, office hours etc.). This is why you
will be asked to leave your name, your student registration number and your
telephone number in all of the events. The data will be stored securely for
four weeks to prevent unauthorised access and either be passed on to the
appropriate authorities should this become necessary or destroyed after four
weeks. 

## [ Dates & Deadlines ](for-students.html#)

## Dates & Deadlines

[Last updated:  17 December 2020]

You can find all dates and potential changes under [dates and
deadlines](https://www.hhu.de/en/studies/organising-your-studies/translate-to-
english-vorlesungszeiten).

The phase of written examinations following the winter semester 2020/2021 is
four weeks long and from 16 February to 12 March 2021. The phase of written
examinations before summer semester 2021 is planned to take place from 22
March to 09 April 2021 (and includes the Easter holidays 2021: from 02 to 05
April 2021).

## Teaching and studying

[Last updated: 18 December 2020]

Due to the latest developments surrounding coronavirus infections in Germany
and in light of the latest decisions of the NRW state government, further
restrictions on teaching and studying at HHU are inevitable. Based on the [new
NRW Coronavirus Protection
Ordinance](https://www.mags.nrw/sites/default/files/asset/document/201214_coronaschvo_ab_16.12.2020.pdf)
and after extensive deliberations of the ‘Taskforce Lehre’ the University’s
management has agreed on the following regulations regarding teaching and
examinations at HHU. They will be in place from 16 December 2020 until 10
January, for the time being:

  * In-person courses and activities are not permitted. This includes e.g. laboratory placements, bedside teaching, trips, language courses and other similar practical activities. The courses will continue online or, if this is not possible, will be postponed. The Christmas holidays will start as planned on 23 December 2020 and end on 05 January 2021. You can find [tips and tricks for studying online here](https://www.hhu.de/lehre/tipps-und-tricks-fuer-das-digitale-studium).
  * For information regarding the adjustments to your courses contact your lecturers, or check the learning platforms ILIAS and Moodle. All communication will take place via your university e-mail address. Please contact your lecturer in case of questions regarding a specific class.
  * As a rule, in-person examinations (i.e. written and oral exams) are not permitted. For the time being, oral exams are planned to take place exclusively online. In a few exceptional cases, deans of study may approve those written exams which cannot be moved to a date after 10 January 2021 for legal or actual reasons.  

Students who depend on the use of a laboratory to complete their final thesis
and whose final thesis has already been registered can, if approved by their
supervisor, continue with their laboratory work. Final theses which do not
require on-campus presence can continue or begin as planned. 

These regulations are based on the new NRW Ministry of Labour, Health and
Social Affairs‘ Coronavirus Protection Ordinance, dated 14 December 2020. It
is very likely that, based on the state’s publication, there will be further
adjustments to the HHU regulations. General adjustments to the regulations in
this context are not to be expected before the conference of the state prime
ministers that is scheduled to take place on 05 January 2021. We will inform
you about the regulations concerning teaching and studying at HHU after 10
January 2021, as soon as possible, but no later than 08 January 2021.

## [ Study rooms on campus ](for-students.html#)

[Last updated: 18 December 2020]

#### Small study rooms

The small study rooms and the lecture theatres on HHU campus that have been
set up to enable participation in online courses and also the study rooms at
the University and State Library have closed on 16 December 2020 until further
notice. We will inform you here when the study rooms become available again.

#### HHU regulations to specity the Coronavirus Epidemic Higher Education
Ordinance

HHU’s rectorate has adopted new regulations regarding the implementation of
the Coronavirus Epidemic University Directive (CEHVO) [ which can be
downloaded
here](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/ZUV/Justitiariat/Amtliche_Bekanntmachungen/2020/2020_12_10_AB_66.pdf).
These regulations provide university-wide specifications for topics such as
flexible teaching and examination formats, withdrawals from examinations,
additional attempts at passing examinations, extension of the individual
standard duration of study (this only applies to summer semester 2020) during
the covid-19 pandemic, i.e. in particular for summer semester 2020 and winter
semester 2020/2021. Please note that regulations in the individual study
programmes can be different. 

The previous HHU regulations regarding the implementation of the Coronavirus
Epidemic University Directive can be accessed vial the following links:.

  * [ HHU’s regulations of 7 May 2020](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Amtliche_Bekanntmachungen_im_Kontext_Corona/Amtliche-Bekanntmachungen_2020_05_07_AB_26.pdf)
  * [ First amendment to regulations dated 21 August 2020](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Amtliche_Bekanntmachungen_im_Kontext_Corona/Amtliche-Bekanntmachungen_2020_08_21_AB_42.pdf)
  * [ Second amendment to regulations dated 02 September 2020](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Amtliche_Bekanntmachungen_im_Kontext_Corona/Amtliche-Bekanntmachungen_2020_09_11_AB_44.pdf)

#### Written exams

Written in-person exams are, as a rule, not permitted. In a very few
exceptional cases the deans of study can approve those in-person written exams
that cannot be moved to a date after 10 January 2021 for legal or actual
reasons. As an alternative, written exams can take place online. Details are
managed by the faculties.

Please inform yourself about the dates for written exams, exam regulations and
the applicable registration and deregistration regulations for exams on the
websites of the subject(s) you are studying, in the student portal and on the
faculties’ websites. If you have any questions, please contact the responsible
dean of studies’ office by e-mail.

In winter semester 2020/2021, the failure to appear for an exam also counts as
a permissible withdrawal from the exam, provided the [ regulations issued by
the
rectorate](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/ZUV/Justitiariat/Amtliche_Bekanntmachungen/2020/2020_12_10_AB_66.pdf)
allow for this. In case of questions, please contact your dean of studies'
office or the appropriate examinations committee.

### Oral exams

Individual oral exams can currently only take place online. Details will be
managed by the faculties. Please contact your examiner and/or your dean of
studies in case of questions. 

Students may withdraw from an oral examination until noon of the day before
the examination. To withdraw from an exam, students can contact the examiner
directly. In case of an acute illness, students may withdraw from the exam
until the beginning of the exam if they can provide a doctor’s certificate.

### Enrolment and re-registration

In order to enrol for a course you must have enrolled or re-registered as a
full-time student.

Students can enrol, re-register or change subjects by sending the documents by
post. It is not necessary for students to enrol or re-register in person. It
is currently also possible to determine suitability for switching subjects on
a master’s programme by e-mail. Please [click on this link for information on
applications](https://www.uni-duesseldorf.de/home/en/studying-and-teaching-at-
hhu/studying/erste-schritte-nuetzliches-bewerbung-und-
einschreibung/information-for-foreign-applicants/application-as-a-foreign-
student.html).

If you have any questions, please contact the Student Services hotline at
0211-8112345 or send an . You can find out more about responsibilities in the
[OnSSC](https://www.uni-duesseldorf.de/home/studium-und-lehre-an-der-
hhu/studium/studienberatung2/onssc.html).

### Periods of study abroad

Erasmus stays abroad can go ahead as planned provided that the host university
remains open to exchange students. A mix of digital and in-person lectures is
possible here. At this point in time, it is not fully clear yet if fully
digital semesters can be sponsored. You will only receive financial support
for periods where you stayed abroad, no matter whether you use only digital or
in-person teaching offers. As long as you are taking courses digitally from
Germany, the International Office is not allowed to support this financially.

A stay abroad is possible and eligible for financial support even if the
German Federal Foreign Office has issued a travel warning. However, the
International Office expressly points out that health and safety are naturally
top priorities in the Erasmus+ programme, too. The German Academic Exchange
Service (DAAD) therefore advises against staying in a high-risk area. Please
refer to the travel warnings for tourist travel that the [German Federal
Foreign Office](https://www.auswaertiges-
amt.de/de/ReiseUndSicherheit/covid-19/2296762) updates on a regular basis.
When returning from a high-risk area, please observe the [RKI’s applicable
regulations](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/nCoV.html)
regarding quarantine and/or testing.

If they wish, students may postpone their semester abroad intended to take
place during winter semester 2020/21 and do it in summer semester 2021.
However, they have to get permission from the Erasmus officer in their
respective subject and the host university. They also have to notify HHU’s
International Office. They should also bear in mind that summer semesters in
other countries often begin as early as January or February (and can therefore
collide with the end of HHU’s winter semester). 

In the light of the current situation, the International Office recommends
that you do not pay any travel expenses or transfer rent/rental deposits too
far in advance.  If you cannot start your stay abroad at short notice due to
measures against the spread of the coronavirus and you have already incurred
costs, the International Office may be able to take over some of the costs.

Please contact  if you have any questions.

The same basically applies to students who receive an HHU Mobility Grant /
PROMOS. However, students who want to postphone their stay abroad until the
summer semester must re-apply for a scholarship by 01 November 2020 because
the scholarships are granted by calendar year only. Please contact  in case of
any questions.

# HHU information on coronavirus

## Current information on coronavirus

## Main points in brief

  * As a rule, in-person lectures are not allowed. Wherever possible, classes will continue to be taught online until the end of the lecture period. Laboratory placements and practical courses can only take place in-person in exceptional cases and only after authorisation by the dean of studies. For more information check the ‚students‘ and ‚lecturers‘ websites.    
  * Oral exams must take place online. Written examinations that have been moved to a new date, as well as planned written examinations may take place in-person, provided the responsible dean of studies approves. Final theses/projects may continue, provided that they either do not require on-campus presence or that the laboratory work is in preparation of or an integral part of an examination, and provided that the lab practice has already begun and that the responsible supervisor approves.  
  * For details about opening hours, access and the services provided by the University and State Library [check the following website ULB](https://www.hhu.de/en/about-hhu/university-and-state-library-ulb).
  * The rectorate has passed [ new regulations to specify the Corona Pandemic Ordinance](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/ZUV/Justitiariat/Amtliche_Bekanntmachungen/2020/2020_12_10_AB_66.pdf) (PDF). These regulations provide almost university-wide specifications regarding flexible teaching and examination formats, withdrawals from exams and additional attempts at passing examinations during the covid-19 pandemic.  
  * Persons who are required to undergo a period of self-isolation as stipulated in the General Regulations of the State of NRW must not enter HHU campus.
  * Persons from areas within Germany with a high number of coronavirus infections, and which sometimes are misleadingly called ‚risk areas‘, may still come to HHU. Only when an area has been put under quarantine by the authorities, persons from this area may no longer enter HHU campus. 
  * A simple face covering must be worn everywhere on HHU campus as well as all inside all buildings used by HHU. The only exceptions are for lecturers during their lectures, provided that the minimum distance of 1.5m to other persons can be maintained, and for employees in their own workspace, provided that the required hygiene measures (e.g. a minimum distance of 1.5m to other persons or separation by (acrylic) glass) can be maintained there.   Please observe the specifications regarding the organisation of on-campus courses at HHU for students and lecturers for winter semester 2020/2021 (as of: 09 November 2020) [[Download PDF](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Handreichung_Lehre_WS2021_09.11.2020_eng.pdf)].
  * Here you can find information about how [ affected HHU employees](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Hygienekonzept/Merkblatt_Umgang_mit_Verdachts-_und_Infektionsfaellen_2020-10-06_GB.pdf) and [ supervisors](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Hinweise_fuer_Fachvorgesetzte_Infektions-_und_Kontaktfaelle_2020-10-06_GB.pdf) should react in case of a (suspected) infection.
  * See [ this link for HHU’s hygiene policy](https://www.corona.hhu.de/en/covid-19-suspected-and-confirmed-cases-hygiene-policy) with information on working in offices and laboratories, examinations, work placements/internships, meetings/conferences and seminar rooms.
  * Regulations and support available to scientists are summarised [on this page](for-employees.html#c452970).
  * The regulations concerning work from home/telework as stipulated in the relevant service agreement have been suspended until 15 January 2021. Persons whose physical presence is required on campus as well as persons who can perform their duties only on campus continue to be obliged to come to campus for work.
  * The Studierendenwerk has announced, that the main canteen (Mensa) in Universitätsstraße and all other cafés and canteens on HHU campus have closed on 16 December until further notice. For more information check the [Studierendenwek website](https://www.stw-d.de).
  * Currently, we are receiving a lot of spam e-mails at HHU that are allegedly sent by ZIM or WHO – please be alert.

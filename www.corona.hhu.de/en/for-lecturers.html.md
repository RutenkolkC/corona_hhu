## Lecturers

## [ Dates ](for-lecturers.html#)

### Dates

 [Last updated: 02 November 2020]

The start of the lecture period for winter semester 2020/2021 has been
postponed to 26 October (for higher semesters and students in master’s
programmes) and 02 November (for first-year students in bachelor’s programmes
and study programmes with a state degree). You can find all dates and
potential changes under [dates and
deadlines](https://www.hhu.de/en/studies/organising-your-studies/translate-to-
english-vorlesungszeiten).

The phase of written examinations following the winter semester is four weeks
long, from 16 February to 12 March 2021. The phase of written examinations
before summer semester 2021 is planned to take place from 22 March to 09 April
2021 (over the Easter holidays 2021: from 02 to 05 April 2021). 

## [ Teaching activities and studies ](for-lecturers.html#)

** ** [Last updated: 12 November 2020]

The winter semester 2020/21 at HHU will be a hybrid semester comprised of in-
person, classroom teaching and online teaching. Only in this way can HHU
continue to offer excellent teaching for all students during the coronavirus
pandemic without giving up its commitment to being an on-campus, classroom-
based university. Courses for first-year and international students take
priority to give them the opportunity to get to know the university and meet
their fellow students and to help them adapt to life at university. However,
in light of the current framework conditions, most of the courses offered will
take place online.

#### In-person teaching

In-person teaching will take place in accordance with the Corona Pandemic
Ordinance and the General Direction of the State of NRW. Together with the
‚Task Force Lehre‘, the Rectorate has looked into the framework conditions and
possibilities regarding in-person teaching during winter semester 2020/2021 in
detail and developed specifications for the organisation of on-campus courses
at HHU. These specifications have been adopted by the Rectorate and provide
the framework for the organisation of in-person teaching during winter
semester 2020/2021 at HHU:

[ Specifications regarding the organisation of on-campus teaching for students
and lecturers in winter semester 2020/2021 at
HHU](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Handreichung_Lehre_WS2021_09.11.2020_eng.pdf)
(as of: 09 November 2020).

These organisation specifications will be updated regularly and adapted in
accordance with the changing threat situation in connection with the Covid-19
pandemic. You can find the latest version of this document on this website. 

#### Online teaching

Due to limited room resources, most courses will have to be held as digital
courses only. In addition, there will be students who, for various reasons,
will completely or partially be unable to come to HHU. They should also have
the opportunity to participate in digital teaching. That’s why, in principle,
all courses should also be offered digitally in the winter semester, unless
the specific nature of the event makes in-person attendance compulsory, and
this has been determined following consultation with the relevant deans of
studies.

Based on experiences from the summer semester and results of the student
survey, HHU recommends offering all online courses live, at least in phases,
so that students can directly interact with the lecturers and fellow students.
Independently of this, HHU suggests that lecturers additionally record all
(live) formats for the students and provide them to the students in a flexible
way (e.g. via the HHU media library). 



## [ Traceability ](for-lecturers.html#)

## Traceability

[Last updated: 19 November 2020]

In accordance with the Coronavirus Pandemic Ordinance of the State of NRW that
is currently in place and the general directive applicable to teaching,
personal data must be collected for all teaching and practical activities
which take place on campus in order to be able to trace back potential chains
of infection in the event of an infection. This applies to courses,
examinations, exam viewings, info events, consultation hours, the use of study
rooms, etc. if these activities place on campus. The specifications about on-
campus courses which you can download from the [ hygiene policy
site](https://www.corona.hhu.de/en/covid-19-suspected-and-confirmed-cases-
hygiene-policy), also contains information about basic and advanced
traceability as well as what to do in case of a (suspected) infection in a
teaching environment. Please note that the collection of this data is for
tracing purposes only and that the data will only be passed on to the
responsible health authorities upon request. The lecturers are obliged to
collect the data, keep it safe and protected from access by unauthorised third
parties and to destroy it after four weeks in accordance with data protection
regulations. 

For the collection of the data you can use [ this
form](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Vordruck_Rueckverfolgbarkeit_v4.pdf).

The corresponding date protection information [ can be found here in
German](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Informationsblatt_Datenschutzhinweise_Kontaktnachverfolgung_2020-10-13.pdf)
and [ in
English](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Informationsblatt_Datenschutzhinweise_Kontaktnachverfolgung_2020-10-13_GB.pdf).

## [ Examinations ](for-lecturers.html#)

## Examinations

[Last updated on: 14 September 2020]

#### General regulations

The Rectorate of HHU has adopted regulations to implement the Corona Epidemic
University Ordinance (CEHVO).

  * [ HHU regulations of 7 May 2020](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/ZUV/Justitiariat/Amtliche_Bekanntmachungen/2020/2020_05_07_AB_26.pdf)
  * [ Amendment to the regulations dated 12 August 2020](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/ZUV/Justitiariat/Amtliche_Bekanntmachungen/2020/2020_08_21_AB_42.pdf)
  * [ Second amendment to the regulations dated 2 September 2020](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Amtliche_Bekanntmachungen_im_Kontext_Corona/Amtliche-Bekanntmachungen_2020_09_11_AB_44.pdf)

In particular, the regulations mandate aspects such as flexible teaching and
examination formats, cancellation policies, free exam attempts or resit
opportunities, extension of the standard period of study during the corona
pandemic. These regulations have been in force since 7 May 2020 and shall
apply to the Bachelor’s and Master’s study programmes at HHU until the start
of the lecture period of winter semester 2020/2021, unless otherwise
stipulated in the examination regulations.  
  
In this context, lecturers are asked to note down non-attendance as an
examination result in the student portal with the abbreviation ″ne.″

#### Written exams and viewing of exam papers

Until further notice, written exams will be coordinated centrally because
capacities in lecture theatres are limited due to the current hygiene
regulations. Specifications regarding the use of lecture theatres and [
recommendations for conducting written exams are provided in this
guide](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Fakultaeten/Mathematisch-
Naturwissenschaftliche_Fakultaet/Dekanat/Dokumente/20_05_20_Empfehlungen_Klausurdurchfuehrung.pdf),
and in the [ leaflet on hygiene
measures](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Hygienekonzept/Merkblatt_Pruefungen_2020-05-04_GB.pdf)
for implementing examinations.

Depending on the size of the group, own office rooms, larger seminar rooms or
lecture theatres can be used to view exam papers in compliance with [ HHU’s
hygiene
concept](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Hygienekonzept/Unterweisung_Schutzmassnahmen_Coronavirus_SAUS_2020-05-04__1__ENG.pdf)
and the traceability regulations. For implementation in seminar rooms and
lecture theatres, the dates must be registered in a timely manner with the
respective dean of studies, also stating the preferred time slot and expected
number of persons. [ Information on viewing exam papers is also provided in
the
guide](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Fakultaeten/Mathematisch-
Naturwissenschaftliche_Fakultaet/Dekanat/Dokumente/MNF-
Empfehlungen_zur_Durchfuehrung_von_Klausureinsichten.pdf).

#### Oral exams

For oral exams requiring in-person presence, the [ hygiene concept
regulations](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Hygienekonzept/Unterweisung_Schutzmassnahmen_Coronavirus_SAUS_2020-20201103_ENG.pdf)
(in particular, continuous adherence to maintaining the minimum distance of
1.5 metres) must be strictly complied with and traceability must be ensured.
 The relevant examiners are responsible for ensuring compliance.

#### Online exams

Oral and written exams can be taken online. We have developed guidelines for
this:

  * [Online written exams](https://www.philo.hhu.de/en/studium-und-lehre/lehre/leitfaden-zur-durchfuehrung-von-online-klausuren?https%3A%2F%2Fwww_philo_hhu_de%2Fstudium-und-lehre%2Flehre%2Fleitfaden-zur-durchfuehrung-von-online-klausuren_html=&cHash=93277f8562cbdf503e4fe0d975beb6ac)
  * [ Oral online video examinations](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/Corona_Website/Corona_pdfs/Leitfaden_zur_Durchfu__hrung_von_Online-Videopru__fungen_final_fu__r_Versand.pdf)

## [ Resources and assistance for online teaching ](for-lecturers.html#)

## Resources and assistance for online teaching

[Updated on: 10 November 2020]

In winter semester 2020/2021 the possibilities for on-campus teaching will be
limited. We have therefore compiled information material on this site that can
help you plan your digital courses. 

For a multiplexed e-learning overview please check the [central e-learning
website](https://www.elearning.hhu.de/en/). It gives you information and
provides resources regarding

  * central e-learning tools,
  * the ILIAS study management system
  * contact persons,
  * services provided
  * online teaching project sponsoring
  * the _Lehrpreis_ teaching award for online teaching
  * video tutorials

as well as further helpful links surrounding digital teaching at HHU.

You can find general information about setting up low-barrier online teaching
and examination formats [ in these
guidelines](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Diversity_Portal/Dokumente/onlinelehre_barrierearm_gestalten_Mai20.pdf).

#### E-learning consultation hour

Once a week there is an [HHU RocketChat on digital
teaching](https://rocketchat.hhu.de/channel/elearning-sprechstunde). Every
Monday and Wednesday from 1.30pm to 2.30pm e-learning experts will answer your
questions, which you can submit to them prior to the actual chat. 

#### Lecture recordings

Microphone systems are available or currently being installed in all of HHU’s
lecture theatres. These systems make it possible to record and stream speech
with your own computer and to integrate it into a presentation shown in the
lecture theatre as a screencast. LAN connections in the lecture theatres
enable the in-person lecture to be streamed live. [Click here for more
detailed
information](https://wiki.hhu.de/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=155157366).
Screencasts produced in the lecture theatre can then, e.g., be made available
through HHU’s media library. In the scope of a pilot project, recorders are
being installed in some lecture theatres, which will make it easier to record
presentations and sound. Cameras can be connected to these recorders, too.
Lecturers have to operate the cameras and learn how to use these devices.

To stream lectures live and/or make them available as screencast videos, you
can use, e.g., external web conference tools like Cisco Webex outside of the
lecture hall. Use of these external systems cannot overload HHU’s network
infrastructure.

All digitalised lectures can be provided via the HHU media library. The videos
can then be integrated into learning platforms such as ILIAS.

In general, when live streaming and recording lectures, copyright law in
teaching, data protection and personal rights of the participants must be
taken into account. Information about this can, e.g., be found on the [Legal
Department’s website](https://www.mitarbeiter.hhu.de/en/zentrale-
universitaetsverwaltung/stabsstellen/stabsstelle-justitiariat/informationen-
zum-urheberrecht) and also on the [Data Protection Unit’s
website](https://www.hhu.de/en/about-hhu/organisation-and-bodies/central-
university-administration/staff-units/staff-unit-data-protection).

#### Learning platform ILIAS

The learning platform ILIAS primarily serves to provide interactive e-learning
offers like chats, forums and online tests as well as pdf files. Video
material should not be uploaded in ILIAS because this will have a strongly
negative impact on ILIAS’ performance. Instead, lecture recordings should be
provided in the HHU media library and interlinked in ILIAS.

## [ Room bookings ](for-lecturers.html#)

## Room bookings

[Updated on: 21 October 2020]

Room bookings for centrally managed rooms will be coordinated centrally until

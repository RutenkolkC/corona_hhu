# Lecturers

## Lecturers topic group

This website gives you regularly updated information on general regulations.
In addition, we recommend that you find out about the faculty-specific
measures or programme-specific measures on the websites for your faculty
and/or your study programme.

## Main points for lecturers in brief

  * From 02 December on, on-campus courses are no longer permitted until further notice. Teaching will exclusively take place online. One exception are classes and on-campus events where personal attendance is vital because the participants depend on special rooms (such as laboratories) or other special framework conditions (e.g. bedside teaching). Another exception are courses for first-year students in bachelor’s and state examination study programmes that have already started. In accordance with the previous regulations, examinations can still take place. Access to the library remains as is.
  * A simple face covering must be worn everywhere on HHU campus as well as all inside all buildings used by HHU. The only exceptions are for lecturers during their lectures, provided that the minimum distance of 1.5m to other persons can be maintained, and for employees in their own workspace, provided that the required hygiene measures (e.g. a minimum distance of 1.5m to other persons or separated by (acrylic) glass) can be maintained there.   
  * Every Monday and Wednesday from 1:30pm to 2:30pm there is an [HHU Rocket.Chat](https://rocketchat.hhu.de/channel/elearning-sprechstunde)  in which the e-learning experts will answer any questions you might have about virtual learning. Feel free to post your questions there before the actual chat. For more information about virtual learning see [HHU‘s central e-learning website](https://www.elearning.hhu.de/en/).
  * The main canteen (Mensa) in Universitätsstraße is currently still open every weekday from 11.30am – 2pm. You must book a seat no longer than 48 hours ahead [via the Studierendenwerk website](https://www.stw-d.de/) if you want to have lunch there. The Mensa, Café Uno and Mensa Süd will all close on 16 December. The ‘Cafeteria Süd’ closed on 11 December 2020.
  * The rectorate has adopted [ new regulations that specify the Corona Pandemic Ordinance](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/ZUV/Justitiariat/Amtliche_Bekanntmachungen/2020/2020_12_10_AB_66.pdf). These regulations provide more or less university-wide specification for topics such as flexible teaching and examination formats, withdrawal from examinations and additional attempts at taking an examination during the coronavirus pandemic.

Last updated: 14 December 2020: Main points in brief;  11 December 2020:
examinations.

## Lecturers

## [ Dates ](for-lecturers.html#)

### Dates

 [Last updated: 02 November 2020]

The start of the lecture period for winter semester 2020/2021 has been
postponed to 26 October (for higher semesters and students in master’s
programmes) and 02 November (for first-year students in bachelor’s programmes
and study programmes with a state degree). You can find all dates and
potential changes under [dates and
deadlines](https://www.hhu.de/en/studies/organising-your-studies/translate-to-
english-vorlesungszeiten).

The phase of written examinations following the winter semester is four weeks
long, from 16 February to 12 March 2021. The phase of written examinations
before summer semester 2021 is planned to take place from 22 March to 09 April
2021 (over the Easter holidays 2021: from 02 to 05 April 2021). 

## [ Teaching activities and studies ](for-lecturers.html#)

** ** [Last updated: 02 December 2020]



The new General Degree passed by the State of NRW on teaching, practical
activities and examinations at higher education institutions introduces
restrictions concerning teaching operations and examinations. With regard to
teaching operations this means: 

From 02 December on, all teaching activities will take place online. The only
exception are classes and on-campus activities where personal attendance is
vital because the participants depend on special facilities (e.g.
laboratories) or other special framework conditions (e.g. bedside teaching).
Another exception are courses for first-year students in bachelor’s and state
examination programmes that have already started and which were designed as
on-campus or hybrid courses. Please inform your students about any adjustments
to your courses.

See further down this coronavirus information website for helpful information
on digital teaching.

During all on-campus activities participants must wear a face covering. The
only exception are lecturers, provided they can maintain the required minimum
distance to the other persons present in the room. The relevant hygiene and
safety measures must be observed during all activities. In case of in-person
activities, adequate contact tracing in case of infection must be guaranteed.

#### Online teaching

Based on experiences from the summer semester and results of the student
survey, HHU recommends offering all online courses live, at least in phases,
so that students can directly interact with the lecturers and fellow students.
Independently of this, HHU suggests that lecturers additionally record all
(live) formats for the students and provide them to the students in a flexible
way (e.g. via the HHU media library). 

## [ Traceability ](for-lecturers.html#)

## Traceability

[Last updated: 19 November 2020]

In accordance with the Coronavirus Pandemic Ordinance of the State of NRW that
is currently in place and the general directive applicable to teaching,
personal data must be collected for all teaching and practical activities
which take place on campus in order to be able to trace back potential chains
of infection in the event of an infection. This applies to courses,
examinations, exam viewings, info events, consultation hours, the use of study
rooms, etc. if these activities place on campus. The specifications about on-
campus courses which you can download from the [ hygiene policy
site](https://www.corona.hhu.de/en/covid-19-suspected-and-confirmed-cases-
hygiene-policy), also contains information about basic and advanced
traceability as well as what to do in case of a (suspected) infection in a
teaching environment. Please note that the collection of this data is for
tracing purposes only and that the data will only be passed on to the
responsible health authorities upon request. The lecturers are obliged to
collect the data, keep it safe and protected from access by unauthorised third
parties and to destroy it after four weeks in accordance with data protection
regulations. 

For the collection of the data you can use [ this
form](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Vordruck_Rueckverfolgbarkeit_v4.pdf).

The corresponding date protection information [ can be found here in
German](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Informationsblatt_Datenschutzhinweise_Kontaktnachverfolgung_2020-10-13.pdf)
and [ in
English](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Informationsblatt_Datenschutzhinweise_Kontaktnachverfolgung_2020-10-13_GB.pdf).

## [ Examinations ](for-lecturers.html#)

## Examinations

[Last updated on: 11 December 2020]

#### General regulations

HHU’s rectorate has adopted new regulations regarding the implementation of
the Coronavirus Epidemic University Ordinance (CEHVO) which [ can be
downloaded
here](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/ZUV/Justitiariat/Amtliche_Bekanntmachungen/2020/2020_12_10_AB_66.pdf).
These regulations provide almost university-wide specifications for topics
such as flexible teaching and examination formats, withdrawals from
examinations, additional attempts at passing examinations, extension of the
individual standard duration of study (this only applies to summer semester
2020) during the covid-19 pandemic, i.e. in particular for summer semester
2020 and winter semester 2020/2021. Please note that regulations for the
individual study programmes can be different. 

In this context, lecturers are asked to note non-attendance as an examination
result “ne“ in the student portal.

The previous HHU regulations regarding the implementation of the Coronavirus
Epidemic University Ordinance can be accessed vial the following links:

  * [ HHU regulations of 7 May 2020](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/ZUV/Justitiariat/Amtliche_Bekanntmachungen/2020/2020_05_07_AB_26.pdf)
  * [ Amendment to the regulations dated 12 August 2020](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/ZUV/Justitiariat/Amtliche_Bekanntmachungen/2020/2020_08_21_AB_42.pdf)
  * [ Second amendment to the regulations dated 2 September 2020](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Amtliche_Bekanntmachungen_im_Kontext_Corona/Amtliche-Bekanntmachungen_2020_09_11_AB_44.pdf)

#### Written exams and viewing of exam papers

Until further notice, written exams will be coordinated centrally because
capacities in lecture theatres are limited due to the current hygiene
regulations. Specifications regarding the use of lecture theatres and [
recommendations for conducting written exams are provided in this
guide](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Fakultaeten/Mathematisch-
Naturwissenschaftliche_Fakultaet/Dekanat/Dokumente/20_05_20_Empfehlungen_Klausurdurchfuehrung.pdf),
and in the [ leaflet on hygiene
measures](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Hygienekonzept/Merkblatt_Pruefungen_2020-05-04_GB.pdf)
for implementing examinations.

Until further notice, exam papers can continue to be viewed in compliance with
[ HHU’s hygiene
concept](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Hygienekonzept/Unterweisung_Schutzmassnahmen_Coronavirus_SAUS_2020-05-04__1__ENG.pdf)
and the regulations on contact tracing. For an exam viewing, please book an
available lecture theatre stating the date, the preferred time-slot and
expected number of persons in a timely manner via the responsible dean of
studies’ office. [ Information on viewing exam papers is also provided in the
guide](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Fakultaeten/Mathematisch-
Naturwissenschaftliche_Fakultaet/Dekanat/Dokumente/MNF-
Empfehlungen_zur_Durchfuehrung_von_Klausureinsichten.pdf).

#### Oral exams

For oral exams requiring in-person presence, the [ hygiene concept
regulations](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Hygienekonzept/Unterweisung_Schutzmassnahmen_Coronavirus_SAUS_2020-20201103_ENG.pdf)
(in particular, continuous adherence to maintaining the minimum distance of
1.5 metres) must be strictly complied with and traceability must be ensured.
 The relevant examiners are responsible for ensuring compliance.

#### Online exams

Oral and written exams can be taken online. Any details will be manage by the
individual faculties. To assist you, we have developed guidelines which can be
followed within the framework of the individual faculty’s regulations:

  * [Online written exams](https://www.philo.hhu.de/en/studium-und-lehre/lehre/leitfaden-zur-durchfuehrung-von-online-klausuren?https%3A%2F%2Fwww_philo_hhu_de%2Fstudium-und-lehre%2Flehre%2Fleitfaden-zur-durchfuehrung-von-online-klausuren_html=&cHash=93277f8562cbdf503e4fe0d975beb6ac)
  * [ Oral online video examinations](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/Corona_Website/Corona_pdfs/Leitfaden_zur_Durchfu__hrung_von_Online-Videopru__fungen_final_fu__r_Versand.pdf)

## [ Resources and assistance for online teaching ](for-lecturers.html#)

## Resources and assistance for online teaching

[Updated on: 10 November 2020]

In winter semester 2020/2021 the possibilities for on-campus teaching will be
limited. We have therefore compiled information material on this site that can
help you plan your digital courses. 

For a multiplexed e-learning overview please check the [central e-learning
website](https://www.elearning.hhu.de/en/). It gives you information and
provides resources regarding

  * central e-learning tools,
  * the ILIAS study management system
  * contact persons,
  * services provided
  * online teaching project sponsoring
  * the _Lehrpreis_ teaching award for online teaching
  * video tutorials

as well as further helpful links surrounding digital teaching at HHU.

You can find general information about setting up low-barrier online teaching
and examination formats [ in these
guidelines](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Diversity_Portal/Dokumente/onlinelehre_barrierearm_gestalten_Mai20.pdf).

#### E-learning consultation hour

Once a week there is an [HHU RocketChat on digital
teaching](https://rocketchat.hhu.de/channel/elearning-sprechstunde). Every
Monday and Wednesday from 1.30pm to 2.30pm e-learning experts will answer your
questions, which you can submit to them prior to the actual chat. 

#### Lecture recordings

Microphone systems are available or currently being installed in all of HHU’s
lecture theatres. These systems make it possible to record and stream speech
with your own computer and to integrate it into a presentation shown in the
lecture theatre as a screencast. LAN connections in the lecture theatres
enable the in-person lecture to be streamed live. [Click here for more
detailed
information](https://wiki.hhu.de/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=155157366).
Screencasts produced in the lecture theatre can then, e.g., be made available
through HHU’s media library. In the scope of a pilot project, recorders are
being installed in some lecture theatres, which will make it easier to record
presentations and sound. Cameras can be connected to these recorders, too.
Lecturers have to operate the cameras and learn how to use these devices.

To stream lectures live and/or make them available as screencast videos, you
can use, e.g., external web conference tools like Cisco Webex outside of the
lecture hall. Use of these external systems cannot overload HHU’s network
infrastructure.

All digitalised lectures can be provided via the HHU media library. The videos
can then be integrated into learning platforms such as ILIAS.

In general, when live streaming and recording lectures, copyright law in
teaching, data protection and personal rights of the participants must be
taken into account. Information about this can, e.g., be found on the [Legal
Department’s website](https://www.mitarbeiter.hhu.de/en/zentrale-
universitaetsverwaltung/stabsstellen/stabsstelle-justitiariat/informationen-
zum-urheberrecht) and also on the [Data Protection Unit’s
website](https://www.hhu.de/en/about-hhu/organisation-and-bodies/central-
university-administration/staff-units/staff-unit-data-protection).

#### Learning platform ILIAS

The learning platform ILIAS primarily serves to provide interactive e-learning
offers like chats, forums and online tests as well as pdf files. Video
material should not be uploaded in ILIAS because this will have a strongly
negative impact on ILIAS’ performance. Instead, lecture recordings should be
provided in the HHU media library and interlinked in ILIAS.

## [ Room bookings ](for-lecturers.html#)

## Room bookings

[Updated on: 21 October 2020]

Room bookings for centrally managed rooms will be coordinated centrally until

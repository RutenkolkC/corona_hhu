**for lecturers**

# Lecturers

## Lecturers topic group

This website gives you regularly updated information on general regulations.
In addition, we recommend that you find out about the faculty-specific
measures or programme-specific measures on the websites for your faculty
and/or your study programme.

## Main points for lecturers in brief

  * A simple face covering must be worn everywhere on HHU campus as well as all inside all buildings used by HHU. The only exceptions are for lecturers during their lectures, provided that the minimum distance of 1.5m to other persons can be maintained, and for employees in their own workspace, provided that the required hygiene measures (e.g. a minimum distance of 1.5m to other persons or separated by (acrylic) glass) can be maintained there.   
  * Persons who are required to undergo a period of self-isolation as stipulated in the General Regulations of the State of NRW must not enter HHU campus.
  * Persons from areas within Germany with a high number of coronavirus infections, and which sometimes are misleadingly called ‚risk areas‘, may still come to HHU. Only when an area has been put under quarantine by the authorities, persons from this area may no longer enter HHU campus.  
  * Please observe the [ specifications regarding the organisation of on-campus courses at HHU for students and lecturers in winter semester 2020/2021](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Handreichung_Lehre_WS2021_21.10.2020_01.pdf) (as of: 21 October 2020).
  * Every Monday and Wednesday from 1:30pm to 2:30pm there is an [HHU Rocket.Chat](https://rocketchat.hhu.de/channel/elearning-sprechstunde)  in which the e-learning experts will answer any questions you might have about virtual learning. Feel free to post your questions there before the actual chat. For more information about virtual learning see [HHU‘s central e-learning website](https://www.elearning.hhu.de/en/).
  * The official welcome address for first-year students by the HHU President and the Vice President for the Quality in Studies will take place on 02 November 2020 in the context of an [online welcome event for first-year students](https://hhu.expo-ip.com/).
  * From 26 October on, the main canteen (‚Mensa‘) will be open daily from 11:30am – 2pm and offer a limited choice of meals. If you wish to eat there you must book a seat up to 48 hours in advance via [the Studierendenwerk website](https://www.stw-d.de/).

Last updated: 02 November 2020: Main points in brief;  dates and deadlines;
assistance for online teaching

## Lecturers

## [ Dates ](for-lecturers.html#)

### Dates

 [Last updated: 02 November 2020]

The start of the lecture period for winter semester 2020/2021 has been
postponed to 26 October (for higher semesters and students in master’s
programmes) and 02 November (for first-year students in bachelor’s programmes
and study programmes with a state degree). You can find all dates and
potential changes under [dates and
deadlines](https://www.hhu.de/en/studium/studienorganisation/vorlesungszeiten).

The phase of written examinations following the winter semester is four weeks
long, from 16 February to 12 March 2021. The phase of written examinations
before summer semester 2021 is planned to take place from 22 March to 09 April
2021 (over the Easter holidays 2021: from 02 to 05 April 2021). 

## [ Teaching activities and studies ](for-lecturers.html#)

#### Teaching activities and studies in summer semester 2020

[Last updated: 22 October 2020]

The winter semester 2020/21 at HHU will be a hybrid semester comprised of in-
person, classroom teaching and online teaching. Only in this way can HHU
continue to offer excellent teaching for all students during the coronavirus
pandemic without giving up its commitment to being an on-campus, classroom-
based university. Courses for first-year and international students take
priority to give them the opportunity to get to know the university and meet
their fellow students and to help them adapt to life at university. However,
in light of the current framework conditions, most of the courses offered will
take place online.

#### In-person teaching

In-person teaching will take place in accordance with the Corona Pandemic
Ordinance and the General Direction of the State of NRW. Together with the
‚Task Force Lehre‘, the Rectorate has looked into the framework conditions and
possibilities regarding in-person teaching during winter semester 2020/2021 in
detail and developed specifications for the organisation of on-campus courses
at HHU. These specifications have been adopted by the Rectorate and provide
the framework for the organisation of in-person teaching during winter
semester 2020/2021 at HHU:

[ Specifications regarding the organisation of on-campus teaching for students
and lecturers in winter semester 2020/2021 at
HHU](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Handreichung_Lehre_WS2021_21.10.2020_01.pdf)
(as of: 21 October 2020).

These organisation specifications will be updated regularly and adapted in
accordance with the changing threat situation in connection with the Covid-19
pandemic. You can find the latest version of this document on this website. 

The traceability of all participants in case of infection must be guaranteed
for all on-campus courses and events (lectures, personal consultations,
examinations, etc.) as stipulated by the Corona Pandemic Ordinance. To that
aim, the lecturers will note down the contact details (name, matriculation
number, telephone number) of all participants in on-campus lectures. They can
use [ this
form](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Vordruck_Rueckverfolgbarkeit_v4.pdf).
The corresponding [ data protection information can be downloaded
here](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Informationsblatt_Datenschutzhinweise_Kontaktnachverfolgung_2020-10-13_GB.pdf).
To be able to trace contact persons more accurately, a seating plan showing
who sat next to who must be kept. This is the individual lecturer’s
responsibility.

#### Online teaching

Due to limited room resources, most courses will have to be held as digital
courses only. In addition, there will be students who, for various reasons,
will completely or partially be unable to come to HHU. They should also have
the opportunity to participate in digital teaching. That’s why, in principle,
all courses should also be offered digitally in the winter semester, unless
the specific nature of the event makes in-person attendance compulsory, and
this has been determined following consultation with the relevant deans of
studies.

Based on experiences from the summer semester and results of the student
survey, HHU recommends offering all online courses live, at least in phases,
so that students can directly interact with the lecturers and fellow students.
Independently of this, HHU suggests that lecturers additionally record all
(live) formats for the students and provide them to the students in a flexible
way (e.g. via the HHU media library). 

## [ Examinations ](for-lecturers.html#)

## Examinations

[Last updated on: 14 September 2020]

#### General regulations

The Rectorate of HHU has adopted regulations to implement the Corona Epidemic
University Ordinance (CEHVO).

  * [ HHU regulations of 7 May 2020](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/ZUV/Justitiariat/Amtliche_Bekanntmachungen/2020/2020_05_07_AB_26.pdf)
  * [ Amendment to the regulations dated 12 August 2020](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/ZUV/Justitiariat/Amtliche_Bekanntmachungen/2020/2020_08_21_AB_42.pdf)
  * [ Second amendment to the regulations dated 2 September 2020](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Amtliche_Bekanntmachungen_im_Kontext_Corona/Amtliche-Bekanntmachungen_2020_09_11_AB_44.pdf)

In particular, the regulations mandate aspects such as flexible teaching and
examination formats, cancellation policies, free exam attempts or resit
opportunities, extension of the standard period of study during the corona
pandemic. These regulations have been in force since 7 May 2020 and shall
apply to the Bachelor’s and Master’s study programmes at HHU until the start
of the lecture period of winter semester 2020/2021, unless otherwise
stipulated in the examination regulations.  
  
In this context, lecturers are asked to note down non-attendance as an
examination result in the student portal with the abbreviation ″ne.″

#### Written exams and viewing of exam papers

Until further notice, written exams will be coordinated centrally because
capacities in lecture theatres are limited due to the current hygiene
regulations. Specifications regarding the use of lecture theatres and [
recommendations for conducting written exams are provided in this
guide](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Fakultaeten/Mathematisch-
Naturwissenschaftliche_Fakultaet/Dekanat/Dokumente/20_05_20_Empfehlungen_Klausurdurchfuehrung.pdf),
and in the [ leaflet on hygiene
measures](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Hygienekonzept/Merkblatt_Pruefungen_2020-05-04_GB.pdf)
for implementing examinations.

Depending on the size of the group, own office rooms, larger seminar rooms or
lecture theatres can be used to view exam papers in compliance with [ HHU’s
hygiene
concept](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Hygienekonzept/Unterweisung_Schutzmassnahmen_Coronavirus_SAUS_2020-05-04__1__ENG.pdf)
and the traceability regulations. For implementation in seminar rooms and
lecture theatres, the dates must be registered in a timely manner with the
respective dean of studies, also stating the preferred time slot and expected
number of persons. [ Information on viewing exam papers is also provided in
the
guide](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Fakultaeten/Mathematisch-
Naturwissenschaftliche_Fakultaet/Dekanat/Dokumente/MNF-
Empfehlungen_zur_Durchfuehrung_von_Klausureinsichten.pdf).

#### Oral exams

For oral exams requiring in-person presence, the hygiene concept regulations
(in particular, continuous adherence to maintaining the minimum distance of
1.5 metres) must be strictly complied with and traceability must be ensured.
 The relevant examiners are responsible for ensuring compliance.

#### Online exams

Oral and written exams can be taken online. We have developed guidelines for
this:

  * [Online written exams](https://www.philo.hhu.de/en/studium-und-lehre/lehre/leitfaden-zur-durchfuehrung-von-online-klausuren?https%3A%2F%2Fwww_philo_hhu_de%2Fstudium-und-lehre%2Flehre%2Fleitfaden-zur-durchfuehrung-von-online-klausuren_html=&cHash=93277f8562cbdf503e4fe0d975beb6ac)
  * [ Oral online video examinations](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/Corona_Website/Corona_pdfs/Leitfaden_zur_Durchfu__hrung_von_Online-Videopru__fungen_final_fu__r_Versand.pdf)

## [ Assistance for digital lectures ](for-lecturers.html#)

## Assistance for digital lectures

[Updated on: 02 November 2020]

In winter semester 2020/2021 the possibilities for on-campus teaching will be
limited. We have therefore compiled information material on this site that can
help you plan your digital courses. 

For a first overview please check HHU’s [central e-learning
website](https://www.elearning.hhu.de/). It gives you information and
instructions regarding central e-learning tools, contact persons, services
offered as well as further helpful links surrounding digital teaching at HHU.

You can find further general suggestions and didactic assistance for your
digital courses [in these guidelines](https://www.philo.hhu.de/studium-und-
lehre/lehre/digitalisierung-der-lehre-an-der-philosophischen-fakultaet-
sommersemester-2020.html), on the [learning platform
ILIAS](https://ilias.hhu.de/ilias/login.php?target=wiki_wpage_8149_615900&cmd=force_login&lang=de)
(Login mit Uni-Kennung), or in these [ guidelines on low-barrier online
teaching](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Onlinelehre_barrierearm_gestalten_20200505.pdf).

Once a week there is an [HHU RocketChat on digital
teaching](https://rocketchat.hhu.de/channel/elearning-sprechstunde). Every
Monday and Wednesday from 1.30pm to 2.30pm e-learning experts will answer your
questions, which you can submit to them prior to the actual chat. 

#### Lecture recordings

Microphone systems are available or currently being installed in all of HHU’s
lecture theatres. These systems make it possible to record and stream speech
with your own computer and to integrate it into a presentation shown in the
lecture theatre as a screencast. LAN connections in the lecture theatres
enable the in-person lecture to be streamed live. Screencasts produced in the
lecture theatre can then, e.g., be made available through HHU’s media library.
In the scope of a pilot project, recorders are being installed in some lecture
theatres, which will make it easier to record presentations and sound. Cameras
can be connected to these recorders, too. Lecturers have to operate the
cameras and learn how to use these devices.

To stream lectures live and/or make them available as screencast videos, you
can use, e.g., external web conference tools like Cisco Webex outside of the
lecture hall. Use of these external systems cannot overload HHU’s network
infrastructure.

Lecture recordings in the lecture hall with technical support from ZIM or MMZ
can only be done on a very limited basis due to the existing technical and
personnel resources.

All digitalised lectures can be provided via the HHU media library. The videos
can then be integrated into learning platforms like ILIAS.

In general, when live streaming and recording lectures, copyright law in
teaching, data protection and personal rights of the participants must be
taken into account. Information about this can, e.g., be found on the [Legal
Department’s website](https://www.mitarbeiter.hhu.de/en/zentrale-
universitaetsverwaltung/stabsstellen/stabsstelle-justitiariat/informationen-
zum-urheberrecht).

#### Learning platform ILIAS

The learning platform ILIAS primarily serves to provide interactive e-learning
offers like chats, forums and online tests as well as pdf files. Video
material should not be uploaded in ILIAS because this will have a strongly
negative impact on ILIAS’ performance. Instead, lecture recordings should be
provided in the HHU media library and interlinked in ILIAS.

Supported by a specialised service provider, ZIM is currently optimising and
stabilising the learning platform ILIAS. However, in order to prevent
overloading of ILIAS in the winter semester due to an overly high number of
simultaneous accesses, lecturers are asked to provide the materials in a
timely manner and to also communicate this to the students. Here, it should be
taken into consideration that access rates on ILIAS are particularly high on
Mondays, which slows down the system’s response time. We therefore urgently
ask you to make it possible for the students to download materials in a
staggered way over a period of time.

#### Copyright law

  * In the [guide for digital teaching and learning](https://ilias.hhu.de/ilias/ilias.php?ref_id=1&cmdClass=ilrepositorygui&cmdNode=6k&baseClass=ilrepositorygui) in ILIAS, you’ll find legal backgrounds, tips and illustrative material (log in using your univ. ID).
  * [Information and material](https://www.mitarbeiter.hhu.de/en/zentrale-universitaetsverwaltung/stabsstellen/stabsstelle-justitiariat/informationen-zum-urheberrecht) regarding legally applicable aspects of copyright and personal right law in lectures concerning the [issue of data protection](https://www.mitarbeiter.hhu.de/en/zentrale-universitaetsverwaltung/stabsstellen/stabsstelle-datenschutz/datenschutz-bei-foto-und-filmaufnahmen) for audio and film recordings (log in using your univ. ID).
  * [Copyright law in science](https://www.bmbf.de/de/was-forschende-und-lehrende-wissen-sollten-9523.html).

#### Digitalisation assistants

digitalisierungshilfskraefte.html) for the qualification offered.

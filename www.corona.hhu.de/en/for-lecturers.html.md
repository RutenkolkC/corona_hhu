### Dates

 [Last updated: 18 December 2020]

deadlines](https://www.hhu.de/en/studies/organising-your-studies/translate-to-
english-vorlesungszeiten).

## [ Teaching activities and studies ](for-lecturers.html#)

** ** [Last updated: 18 December 2020]

Due to the latest developments surrounding coronavirus infections in Germany
and in light of the NRW state government decisions, further restrictions on
teaching and studying at HHU are inevitable. Based on the [new NRW Ministry of
Labour, Health and Social Affairs‘ Coronavirus Protection
Ordinance](https://www.mags.nrw/sites/default/files/asset/document/201214_coronaschvo_ab_16.12.2020.pdf)
and after extensive deliberations of the ‘Taskforce Lehre’, the University’s
management has agreed on the following regulations regarding teaching and
examinations. They will be in place from Wednesday, 16 December 2020 until 10
January 2021, for the time being. 

  * In-person courses and activities are not permitted. This includes e.g. laboratory placements, bedside teaching, trips, language courses and similar practical activities. These courses will continue, wherever possible, online (with a break over the Christmas holidays from 23 December 2020 – 05 January 2021, of course). Please notify your students of any adjustments to you courses. Futher below on this coronavirus information website you can find resources and assistance for digital teaching.  
  * In-person examinations (i.e. written and oral exams) are not permitted, as a rule. For this reason, oral exams should only take place online, for the time being. In a few, exceptional cases deans of study can approve those exams that cannot be moved to a date after 10 January 2021 due to legal or actual reasons.   
  * Students who depend on the use of a laboratory to complete their final thesis and whose final thesis has already been registered can, if approved by their supervisor, continue with their laboratory work.   
  * The study rooms that have been set up on campus for HHU students to enable participation in online courses and also the study rooms at ULB also closed on 16 December until further notice.
  * From 16 December, the central library and the subject libraries for medicine and law will be open every day from 10am – 3pm. Visits to the library are limited to borrowing media, and this only to work on and prepare scheduled exams/exam components. Detailed information on the current regulations and services (including the services available during the Christmas holidays) can be found on [ULB’s website](https://www.ulb.hhu.de/).
  * As of 16 December, the SSC will be open from 10am – 3pm for urgent requests only and only after prior appointment. To limit the risk of infection, please check whether your request can be resolved with the help of one of [our online services](https://www.hhu.de/ssc) before you schedule an appointment. The SSC will be closed from 23 December 2020 to 03 January 2021.

The Studierendenwerk Düsseldorf has notified HHU that from 16 December 2020
all its canteens and cafés will be closed.

The next conference of the German state prime ministers is scheduled for 05
January 2021. A new Coronavirus Protection Ordinance is expected no sooner
than 06 January 2021. Afterwards, the University management will assess the
regulations and inform about any changes no later than 08 January 2021, in
particular where the possible continuation of laboratory placements is
concerned.  

## [ Traceability ](for-lecturers.html#)

## Traceability

[Last updated: 18 December 2020]

In accordance with the Coronavirus Pandemic Ordinance of the State of NRW that
is currently in place and the general directive applicable to teaching, basic
contact tracing must be ensured for all in-person and practical activities.
This means that the personal data of all participants must be collected in
order to be able to trace back potential chains of infection if necessary.
This currently only still applies to in-person examinations and exam viewings.
Please note that the collection of this data is for tracing purposes only and
that the data will only be passed on to the responsible health authorities
upon request. The lecturers are obliged to collect the data, keep it safe and
protected from access by unauthorised third parties and to destroy it after
four weeks in accordance with data protection regulations. 

For the collection of the data you can use [ this
form](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Vordruck_Rueckverfolgbarkeit_v4.pdf).

The corresponding date protection information [ can be found here in
German](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Informationsblatt_Datenschutzhinweise_Kontaktnachverfolgung_2020-10-13.pdf)
and [ in
English](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Informationsblatt_Datenschutzhinweise_Kontaktnachverfolgung_2020-10-13_GB.pdf).

## [ Examinations ](for-lecturers.html#)

## Examinations

[Last updated on: 18 December 2020]

#### General regulations

HHU’s rectorate has adopted new regulations regarding the implementation of
the Coronavirus Epidemic University Ordinance (CEHVO) which [ can be
downloaded
here](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/ZUV/Justitiariat/Amtliche_Bekanntmachungen/2020/2020_12_10_AB_66.pdf).
These regulations provide almost university-wide specifications for topics
such as flexible teaching and examination formats, withdrawals from
examinations, additional attempts at passing examinations, extension of the
individual standard duration of study (this only applies to summer semester
2020) during the covid-19 pandemic, i.e. in particular for summer semester
2020 and winter semester 2020/2021. Please note that regulations for the
individual study programmes can be different. 

In this context, lecturers are asked to note non-attendance of students
registered for the exam as an examination result “ne“ in the student portal.

The previous HHU regulations regarding the implementation of the Coronavirus
Epidemic University Ordinance can be accessed vial the following links:

  * [ HHU regulations of 7 May 2020](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/ZUV/Justitiariat/Amtliche_Bekanntmachungen/2020/2020_05_07_AB_26.pdf)
  * [ Amendment to the regulations dated 12 August 2020](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/ZUV/Justitiariat/Amtliche_Bekanntmachungen/2020/2020_08_21_AB_42.pdf)
  * [ Second amendment to the regulations dated 2 September 2020](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Amtliche_Bekanntmachungen_im_Kontext_Corona/Amtliche-Bekanntmachungen_2020_09_11_AB_44.pdf)

#### Written exams and viewing of exam papers

Until further notice, written exams will be coordinated centrally because
capacities in lecture theatres are limited due to the current hygiene
regulations. Specifications regarding the use of lecture theatres and [
recommendations for conducting written exams are provided in this
guide](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Fakultaeten/Mathematisch-
Naturwissenschaftliche_Fakultaet/Dekanat/Dokumente/20_05_20_Empfehlungen_Klausurdurchfuehrung.pdf),
and in the [ leaflet on hygiene
measures](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Hygienekonzept/Merkblatt_Pruefungen_2020-05-04_GB.pdf)
for implementing examinations.

Until further notice, exam papers can continue to be viewed in compliance with
[ HHU’s hygiene
concept](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Hygienekonzept/Unterweisung_Schutzmassnahmen_Coronavirus_SAUS_2020-05-04__1__ENG.pdf)
and the regulations on contact tracing. They are planned and organised like
exams (incl. room bookings). This applies mainly to the exam phase following
the winter semester lecture period. For an exam viewing, please book an
available lecture theatre stating the date, the preferred time-slot and
expected number of persons in a timely manner via the responsible dean of
studies’ office. [ Information on viewing exam papers is also provided in the
guide](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Fakultaeten/Mathematisch-
Naturwissenschaftliche_Fakultaet/Dekanat/Dokumente/MNF-
Empfehlungen_zur_Durchfuehrung_von_Klausureinsichten.pdf).

#### Oral exams

For oral exams requiring in-person presence, the [ hygiene concept
regulations](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Presse/Pressemeldungen/Dokumente/Coronavirus_2020/Hygienekonzept/Unterweisung_Schutzmassnahmen_Coronavirus_SAUS_2020-20201103_ENG.pdf)
(in particular, continuous adherence to maintaining the minimum distance of
1.5 metres) must be strictly complied with and traceability must be ensured.
 The relevant examiners are responsible for ensuring compliance.

#### Online exams

Oral in-person exams are currently not permitted. These exams should, for the
time being, only take place online. The faculties are responsible for managing
any details. The same applies to doctoral exams. To assist you, we have put
together [ these
guidelines](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/Corona_Website/Corona_pdfs/Leitfaden_zur_Durchfu__hrung_von_Online-
Videopru__fungen_final_fu__r_Versand.pdf) which you can use within the context
of the faculty’s regulations.

## [ Resources and assistance for online teaching ](for-lecturers.html#)

## Resources and assistance for online teaching

[Updated on: 17 December 2020]

Currently, in-person teaching is not possible. We have therefore compiled
information material on this site that can help you plan your digital courses.

For a multiplexed e-learning overview please check the [central e-learning
website](https://www.elearning.hhu.de/en/). It gives you information and
provides resources regarding

  * central e-learning tools,
  * the ILIAS study management system
  * contact persons,
  * services provided
  * online teaching project sponsoring
  * the _Lehrpreis_ teaching award for online teaching
  * video tutorials

as well as further helpful links surrounding digital teaching at HHU.

You can find general information about setting up low-barrier online teaching
and examination formats [ in these
guidelines](https://www.corona.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Diversity_Portal/Dokumente/onlinelehre_barrierearm_gestalten_Mai20.pdf).

#### E-learning consultation hour

From January 2021, the [HHU RocketChat on digital
teaching](https://rocketchat.hhu.de/channel/elearning-sprechstunde) will take
place every Wednesday from 1.30pm to 2.30pm. Here, e-learning experts will
answer your questions, which you post on the channel prior to the actual chat.

#### Lecture recordings

Microphone systems and connections are available in all of HHU’s lecture
halls. These systems make it possible to record speech as well as the
presentation with your own computer as a screencast. LAN connections in the
lecture halls enable the in-person lecture to be integrated in a video
conference or to be streamed live. Click
[here](https://wiki.hhu.de/pages/viewpage.action?pageld=218072271) for more
detailed information. Screencasts produced in the lecture hall can then, e.g.,
be made available through HHU’s media library.

In the scope of a pilot project, recorders have been installed in the lecture
theatres 3A, 3D, 5C, 5L, 6K and 6L, which will make it possible to record
presentations and sound with your own USB stick. Cameras can be connected to
these recorders, too. Lecturers have to operate the cameras and learn how to
use these devices themselves.

To stream lectures live and/or make them available as screencast videos, you
can use  video conference tools such as Cisco Webex (campus licence).. All
digitalised lectures can be provided via the HHU media library. The videos can
then be integrated into learning platforms such as ILIAS.

In general, when live streaming and recording lectures, copyright law in
teaching, data protection and personal rights of the participants must be
taken into account. Information about this can, e.g., be found on the [Legal
Department’s website](https://www.mitarbeiter.hhu.de/en/zentrale-
universitaetsverwaltung/stabsstellen/stabsstelle-justitiariat/informationen-
zum-urheberrecht) and also on the [Data Protection Unit’s
website](https://www.hhu.de/en/about-hhu/organisation-and-bodies/central-
university-administration/staff-units/staff-unit-data-protection).

#### Learning platform ILIAS

The learning platform ILIAS primarily serves to provide interactive e-learning
offers like chats, forums and online tests as well as pdf files. Video
material should not be uploaded directly in ILIAS because this will have a
strongly negative impact on ILIAS’ performance but should instead be made
available in the HHU media library and interlinked in ILIAS.

## [ Room bookings ](for-lecturers.html#)

## Room bookings

[Updated on: 18 December 2020]

Room bookings for centrally managed rooms will be coordinated centrally until
further notice and can only be booked  after consultation with the deans of
studies’ offices or the room booking management.

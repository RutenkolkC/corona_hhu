### Dates

 [Last updated: 18 December 2020]

You can find all dates and potential changes under [dates and
deadlines](https://www.hhu.de/en/studies/organising-your-studies/translate-to-
english-vorlesungszeiten).

The phase of written examinations following the winter semester is four weeks
long, from 16 February to 12 March 2021. The phase of written examinations
before summer semester 2021 is planned to take place from 22 March to 09 April
2021 (over the Easter holidays 2021: from 02 to 05 April 2021). 

## [ Teaching activities and studies ](for-lecturers.html#)

[Last updated: 22 January 2021]

The following framework conditions regarding teaching and studying at HHU will
be in effect until the end of the lecture period on 12 February 2021:

As a rule, in-person lectures are not allowed. Wherever possible, classes will
continue to be taught online until the end of the lecture period. If required,
and after consulting the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences dean of
studies‘ office, lecturers may use selected lecture theatres for live online
lectures or to record lectures. 

Internships/laboratory placements and other practical activities may only then
take place on campus if alternatives, such as online teaching, re-scheduling
exams or a different type of substitute are not an option. What is more, the
lab placement/internship must be a mandatory component of a bachelor’s or
master’s degree or a mandatory requirement to register for the examination to
obtain a state examination degree. As a general rule, the minimum distance of
1.5m between all persons present must be maintained in the case of on-campus
laboratory placements at all times. Advanced contact tracing is no longer
possible. Also, laboratory placements and other practical activities must be
authorised by the responsible dean of studies. 

Oral exams must continue to take place online. Doctoral defences are treated
like oral examinations.

In-person written exams may only take place if the date for the exam was set
before 16 December 2020 and an alternative format or re-scheduling the exam
are not an option. In addition to that, the exam must be a mandatory component
of a bachelor’s or master’s examination or a mandatory requirement to register
for the examination to obtain a state examination degree. In-person written
exams must take place exclusively in lecture theatres or other well-ventilated
rooms and must be authorised by the responsible dean of studies.

Dates for written examinations set to take place from February will remain as
they are for the time being. As nobody can tell what the framework conditions
will be like then, we have asked the lecturers, as a precautionary measure, to
check whether an alternative format, one that does not require on-campus
presence, is an option.

Exam viewings should take place online, if possible. As a rule, in-person exam
viewings are only possible for students who failed their examinations. They
must take place in lecture theatres or other well-ventilated rooms. The deans
of study authorise the exam viewings and are responsible for booking the
lecture theatres. 

Final theses or projects may continue and can continue to be registered,
provided that they either do not require on-campus presence or that the
laboratory work is in preparation of or an integral part of an examination and
provided that the lab practice has already begun and that the continuation has
been approved by the respective supervisor. Final theses/projects that require
laboratory practice but where the lab practice has not started yet, cannot
take place and cannot be registered at the time being.  

The study rooms on campus which had been set up to enable participation in
online classes, remain closed. Students are advised to only come to campus for
examinations and to attend one of the few in-person classes. 

Persons from administrative districts or towns which have adopted restrictions
to the freedom of movement may travel to HHU to attend in-person classes,
internships/lab placements or examinations. Students affected by this are
asked to contact the registrar’s office in case of any questions.

ULB’s service will also be reduced. Please use ULB’s extensive digital
services. You can only access ULB to pick up pre-requested media or to return
media. At the moment, this applies to media requested from the stacks, inter-
library loans, reservations or to picking up media for work-related purposes,
which you can request in the usual manner. From Friday, 15 January 2021, ULB
will make available various services to request circulating media from the
reading room collection. More detailed information will be made available
successively on ULB’s website ([www.ulb.hhu.de](http://www.ulb.hhu.de)). The
current regulations do not allow for the use of the non-lending collection.

At the end of January, the state government will convene next to decide about
the Covid-19 restrictions at higher education institutions. Once this
information becomes available, the ‚Taskforce Lehre‘ will decide how to
implement these regulations at HHU and let you know no later than 05 February
how teaching and studying will continue at HHU.

## Resources and assistance for online teaching

[Updated on: 15 January 2021]

#### HHU e-learning portal

To find out more about e-learning and for other helpful links surrounding
online teaching, check the [central e-learning
website](https://www.elearning.hhu.de/en/). Every Wednesday from 1.30pm to
2.30pm our e-learning experts will answer any questions you might have in the
[e-learning consultation hour on
Rocket.Chat](https://rocketchat.hhu.de/channel/elearning-sprechstunde).

#### Lecture recordings

Microphone systems and connections are available in all of HHU’s lecture
theatres. These systems make it possible to record in-person lectures as
screencasts or to be streamed live via webex on the lecturer’s computer to
students who attend the lecture live online. For more detailed information
regarding the required technical equipment and its use, [please check this HHU
wiki site](https://wiki.hhu.de/pages/viewpage.action?pageld=218072271). The
screencasts produced in the lecture theatre can then be made available via
HHU’s _Mediathek_ and be integrated into the ILIAS learning platform. 

In the scope of a pilot project, recorders have been installed in lecture
theatres 3A, 3D, 5C, 5L, 6K und 6L, which make it possible to record
presentations and sound with your own USB stick. Cameras can be connected to
these recorders, too. 

Generally, when live streaming and recording lectures, copyright law in
teaching, data protection and personal rights of the participants must be
taken into account. Information about this can be found e.g. [on the Legal
Department’s websites](https://www.mitarbeiter.hhu.de/en/zentrale-
universitaetsverwaltung/stabsstellen/stabsstelle-justitiariat/informationen-
zum-urheberrecht) and [on the website of the Data Protection
Unit](https://www.hhu.de/en/about-hhu/organisation-and-bodies/central-
university-administration/staff-units/staff-unit-data-protection).
